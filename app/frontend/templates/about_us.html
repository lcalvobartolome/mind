        We are a team of researchers from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and the University of Maryland working to uncover inconsistencies and knowledge gaps within the multilingual resources that support multilingual Question Answering systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our work was inspired by
        <a href="https://today.umd.edu/pocket-sized-support-for-new-parents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ROSIE</a>, a bilingual (English and Spanish) health-support chatbot for new parents. Although ROSIE is built on two independent, medically validated knowledge bases, we found that the English and Spanish sources often differ. They sometimes present incomplete, conflicting, or culturally divergent guidelines.

    <p>
        This raised an important question:
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>
            When two answers are grounded in credible evidence yet offer different guidance, which one should we trust?
        </em>
    </p>

    <p>
        MIND aims to address this challenge by systematically detecting such discrepancies. The system lets users select a topic, review the inconsistencies it identifies, and decide if the detection is accurate and how to proceed.
