         "Famine In France, the Hundred Years' War, crop failures and epidemics reduced the population by two-thirds. Economist Amartya Sen has also argued that sustained famines historically have been caused by political instability and repressive political regimes rather than overpopulation. The failure of a harvest or change in conditions, such as drought, can create a situation whereby large numbers of people continue to live where the carrying capacity of the land has temporarily dropped radically. Famine is often associated with subsistence agriculture. The total absence of agriculture in an economically strong area does not cause famine; Arizona and other wealthy regions import the vast majority of their food, since such regions produce sufficient economic goods for trade. Famines have also been caused by volcanism. The 1815 eruption of the Mount Tambora volcano in Indonesia caused crop failures and famines worldwide and caused the worst famine of the 19th century. The current consensus of the scientific community is that the aerosols and dust released into the upper atmosphere causes cooler temperatures by preventing the sun's energy from reaching the ground. The same mechanism is theorized to be caused by very large meteorite impacts to the extent of causing mass extinctions. ===State-sponsored famines=== In certain cases, such as the Great Leap Forward in China (which produced the largest famine in absolute numbers), North Korea in the mid-1990s, or Zimbabwe in the early-2000s, famine can occur because of government policy.",

In fact, paleoclimatogical temperature reconstruction suggests that historical periods of social unrest, societal collapse, and population crash and significant climate change often occurred simultaneously. A team of researchers from Mainland China and Hong Kong were able to establish a causal connection between climate change and large-scale human crises in pre-industrial times. Short-term crises may be caused by social problems, but climate change was the ultimate cause of major crises, starting with economic depressions. Moreover, since agriculture is highly dependent on climate, any changes to the regional climate from the optimum can induce crop failures. After around 1130, North America had significant climatic change in the form of a 300-year period of aridity called the Great Drought. The Mississippian culture collapsed during this period.

The cause for this demographic decline is complicated and significantly unproven. Parker claims that war, climate change and migration are the main factors that contributed to this population crisis. War ravaged Europe for almost the entirety of the century, with no major state avoiding war in the 1640s. Some states saw very few years of peace.

An estimated 50,000 to 150,000 people are reported to have died during the period. In 2012, the Sahel drought put more than 10 million people in the western Sahel at risk of famine (according to a Methodist Relief & Development Fund (MRDF) aid expert), due to a month-long heat wave. Today, famine is most widespread in Sub-Saharan Africa, but with exhaustion of food resources, overdrafting of groundwater, wars, internal struggles, and economic failure, famine continues to be a worldwide problem with hundreds of millions of people suffering. These famines cause widespread malnutrition and impoverishment. The famine in Ethiopia in the 1980s had an immense death toll, although Asian famines of the 20th century have also produced extensive death tolls.

Europe, still recuperating from the Napoleonic Wars, suffered from widespread food shortages, resulting in its worst famine of the century. Low temperatures and heavy rains resulted in failed harvests in Great Britain and Ireland. Famine was prevalent in north and southwest Ireland, following the failure of wheat, oat, and potato harvests. Food prices rose sharply throughout Europe. With the cause of the problems unknown, hungry people demonstrated in front of grain markets and bakeries. Food riots took place in many European cities. Though riots were common during times of hunger, the food riots of 1816 and 1817 were the most violent period on the continent since the French Revolution. Widespread flooding of Europe's major rivers is attributed to the event, as is frost in August. Hungary experienced snowfall colored brown by volcanic ash; in northern Italy, red snow fell throughout the year. In Switzerland, famine was limited to the east, which was densely populated and more industrialized. ===North America=== In the spring and summer of 1816, a persistent \"dry fog\" was observed in parts of the eastern United States. The fog reddened and dimmed sunlight such that sunspots were visible to the naked eye. Neither wind nor rainfall dispersed the \"fog\", retrospectively characterized by Clive Oppenheimer as a \"stratospheric sulfate aerosol veil\".",

At about the same time the Byzantine Empire reached its first acme and Christianity established itself in Europe as the leading monotheistic religion. After this relatively short cool interlude the climate ameliorated again and reached between 800 and 1200 almost the values of the Roman Warm Period (used temperature proxies are sediments in the North Atlantic). This warming happened during the High Middle Ages wherefore this event is known as ''Medieval Global Warming'' or the Medieval Warm Period. This warmer climate peaked around 850 AD and 1050 AD, and raised the tree line in Scandinavia and in Russia by 100 to 140 meters; it enabled the Vikings to settle in Iceland and Greenland. During this period the Crusades took place and the Byzantine Empire was eventually pushed back by the rise of the Ottoman Empire. The end of the Medieval Warm Period coincides with the early 14th century reaching a temperature minimum around 1350, and by the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages. Many settlements were abandoned and left deserted. As a consequence, the population in Central Europe drastically receded by as much as 50 percent.

This has been explained as due to unprecedented strengthening of Pacific trade winds in the last 20 years, so that surface warming has been substantially slowed by increased subsurface ocean heat uptake caused by increased subduction in the Pacific shallow overturning cells, and increased equatorial upwelling in the central and eastern Pacific. A March 2014 study found that climate models assuming natural variability which matched subsequent observations of ENSO phasing had produced realistic estimates of 15-year trends. A study published on August 3, 2014 reported that the rapid warming of the Atlantic Ocean has increased trade winds, thereby cooling temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. This, the study concluded, contributed to the hiatus because such winds trap heat in the deep ocean. Another study published later that month found evidence that a cycle of ocean currents in the Atlantic influences global temperatures by sinking large amounts of heat beneath the oceans, and suggested the hiatus might continue for ten more years because each phase of this cycle lasts for thirty years. The 60- to 80-year cycle of the atmospheric and oceanic variability over the North Atlantic was also linked to the hiatus by two studies published in 2013 and was used to infer the length of the hiatus.",

A 2019 study found scientific consensus to be at 100%,]] In the 1950s, Gilbert Plass created a detailed computer model that included different atmospheric layers and the infrared spectrum. This model predicted that increasing levels would cause warming. Around the same time, Hans Suess found evidence that levels had been rising, and Roger Revelle showed that the oceans would not absorb the increase. The two scientists subsequently helped Charles Keeling to begin a record of continued increase—the \"Keeling Curve\" Studies such as the National Research Council's 1979 Charney Report supported the accuracy of climate models that forecast significant warming. Human causation of observed global warming and dangers of unmitigated warming were publicly presented in James Hansen's 1988 testimony before a US Senate committee. As part of the IPCC reports, scientists assess the scientific discussion that takes place in peer-reviewed journal articles. There is a near-complete scientific consensus that the climate is warming and that this is caused by human activities. As of 2019, agreement in recent literature reached over 99%.

The contribution of each gas to the enhanced greenhouse effect is determined by the characteristics of that gas, its abundance, and any indirect effects it may cause. For example, the direct radiative effect of a mass of methane is about 84 times stronger than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame. Since the 1980s, greenhouse gas forcing contributions (relative to year 1750) are also estimated with high accuracy using IPCC-recommended expressions derived from radiative transfer models. The concentration of a greenhouse gas is typically measured in ''parts per million'' (ppm) or ''parts per billion'' (ppb) by volume. A concentration of 420 ppm means that 420 out of every million air molecules is a molecule. The first 30&nbsp;ppm increase in concentrations took place in about 200 years, from the start of the Industrial Revolution to 1958; however the next 90&nbsp;ppm increase took place within 56 years, from 1958 to 2014.

The scale of change during the last glacial/interglacial transition is indicated with a black bar. ]] The formation of marine terraces is controlled by changes in environmental conditions and by tectonic activity during recent geological times. Changes in climatic conditions have led to eustatic sea-level oscillations and isostatic movements of the Earth's crust, especially with the changes between glacial and interglacial periods. Processes of eustasy lead to glacioeustatic sea level fluctuations due to changes of the water volume in the oceans, and hence to regressions and transgressions of the shoreline. At times of maximum glacial extent during the last glacial period, the sea level was about lower compared to today. Eustatic sea level changes can also be caused by changes in the void volume of the oceans, either through sedimento-eustasy or tectono-eustasy. Processes of isostasy involve the uplift of continental crusts along with their shorelines. Today, the process of glacial isostatic adjustment mainly applies to Pleistocene glaciated areas.

It could then reach by 2100 between and from now and approximately to from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50&nbsp;cm (1.6&nbsp;ft) or even by 1.9&nbsp;m (6.2&nbsp;ft) by 2100. Rising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade.

They are particularly vulnerable due to mangrove plants' reliance on breathing roots or pneumatophores. These will be submerged if the rate is too rapid for them to migrate upward. This would result in the loss of an ecosystem. Both mangroves and tidal marshes protect against storm surges, waves and tsunamis, so their loss makes the effects of sea level rise worse. Human activities such as dam building may restrict sediment supplies to wetlands. This would prevent natural adaptation processes. The loss of some tidal marshes is unavoidable as a consequence. Corals are important for bird and fish life. They need to grow vertically to remain close to the sea surface in order to get enough energy from sunlight. The corals have so far been able to keep up the vertical growth with the rising seas, but might not be able to do so in the future. == Regional variations == thumbSea level rise in many locations across the world is worsened due to land subsidence.

In the recent geological past, thermal expansion from increased temperatures and changes in land ice are the dominant reasons of sea level rise. The last time that the Earth was warmer than pre-industrial temperatures was 120,000 years ago. This was when warming due to Milankovitch cycles (changes in the amount of sunlight due to slow changes in the Earth's orbit) caused the Eemian interglacial. Sea levels during that warmer interglacial were at least higher than now. The Eemian warming was sustained over a period of thousands of years. The size of the rise in sea level implies a large contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Since the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 years ago, sea level has risen by more than . Rates vary from less than 1&nbsp;mm/year during the pre-industrial era to 40+ mm/year when major ice sheets over Canada and Eurasia melted. Meltwater pulses are periods of fast sea level rise caused by the rapid disintegration of these ice sheets. The rate of sea level rise started to slow down about 8,200 years before today.

If temperatures reach or exceed that level, reducing the global temperature to above pre-industrial levels or lower would prevent the loss of the entire ice sheet. One way to do this in theory would be large-scale carbon dioxide removal, but there would still be cause of greater ice losses and sea level rise from Greenland than if the threshold was not breached in the first place. If the tipping point instead is durably but mildly crossed, the ice sheet would take between 10,000 and 15,000 years to disintegrate entirely, with a most likely estimate of 10,000 years. === Mountain glacier loss === thumbupright=1.2Based on national pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, global mean temperature is projected to increase by , which would cause loss of about half of Earth's glaciers by 2100—causing a sea level rise of 115±40 millimeters. There are roughly 200,000 glaciers on Earth, which are spread out across all continents. Less than 1% of glacier ice is in mountain glaciers, compared to 99% in Greenland and Antarctica. However, this small size also makes mountain glaciers more vulnerable to melting than the larger ice sheets. This means they have had a disproportionate contribution to historical sea level rise and are set to contribute a smaller, but still significant fraction of sea level rise in the 21st century.",

They suffer an increased rate of mental and social disorders due to these stresses. At current rates, sea level rise would be high enough to make the Maldives uninhabitable by 2100. Five of the Solomon Islands have already disappeared due to the effects of sea level rise and stronger trade winds pushing water into the Western Pacific. thumbupright=1.5Surface area change of islands in the [[List of islands in the Pacific OceanCentral Pacific and Solomon Islands]]",

         "Vertical datum ==Methods== In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above sea level, although what \"sea level\" actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, tides, topography, and differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of nearby ice sheets, mountains, and density variations in the crust and deep in the mantle. For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is mean sea level (MSL). This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard \"sea level\" for all mapping and surveying in that country. (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at Newlyn in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921). *",

NOAA's ''Global and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios'' said in February 2022 that relative sea level along the contiguous U.S. coastline is expected to rise on average as much over the next 30 years——as it has over the preceding 100 years. More specifically, NOAA's February 2022 ''Sea Level Rise Technical Report'' estimated that rise in the following three decades is anticipated to be, on average: 10-14 inches (0.25-0.35 m) for the East coast; 14-18 inches (0.35-0.45 m) for the Gulf coast; 4-8 inches (0.1-0.2 m) for the West coast; 8-10 inches (0.2-0.25 m) for the Caribbean; 6-8 inches (0.15-0.2 m) for the Hawaiian Islands; and 8-10 inches (0.2-0.25 m) for northern Alaska. The U.S. Geological Survey has conducted research on sea level rise, addressing coastal vulnerability, and incorporating six physical variables to analyze the changes in sea level: geomorphology, coastal slope (percent), rate of relative sea level rise (mm/yr), shoreline erosion and acceleration rates (m/yr), mean tidal range (m), and mean wave height (m). The research was conducted on the various coastline areas of the United States. Along the Pacific coast, the most vulnerable areas are low-lying beaches, and \"their susceptibility is primarily a function of geomorphology and coastal slope.\"",

In the recent geological past, thermal expansion from increased temperatures and changes in land ice are the dominant reasons of sea level rise. The last time that the Earth was warmer than pre-industrial temperatures was 120,000 years ago. This was when warming due to Milankovitch cycles (changes in the amount of sunlight due to slow changes in the Earth's orbit) caused the Eemian interglacial. Sea levels during that warmer interglacial were at least higher than now. The Eemian warming was sustained over a period of thousands of years. The size of the rise in sea level implies a large contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Since the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 years ago, sea level has risen by more than . Rates vary from less than 1&nbsp;mm/year during the pre-industrial era to 40+ mm/year when major ice sheets over Canada and Eurasia melted. Meltwater pulses are periods of fast sea level rise caused by the rapid disintegration of these ice sheets. The rate of sea level rise started to slow down about 8,200 years before today.

If temperatures reach or exceed that level, reducing the global temperature to above pre-industrial levels or lower would prevent the loss of the entire ice sheet. One way to do this in theory would be large-scale carbon dioxide removal, but there would still be cause of greater ice losses and sea level rise from Greenland than if the threshold was not breached in the first place. If the tipping point instead is durably but mildly crossed, the ice sheet would take between 10,000 and 15,000 years to disintegrate entirely, with a most likely estimate of 10,000 years. === Mountain glacier loss === thumbupright=1.2Based on national pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, global mean temperature is projected to increase by , which would cause loss of about half of Earth's glaciers by 2100—causing a sea level rise of 115±40 millimeters. There are roughly 200,000 glaciers on Earth, which are spread out across all continents. Less than 1% of glacier ice is in mountain glaciers, compared to 99% in Greenland and Antarctica. However, this small size also makes mountain glaciers more vulnerable to melting than the larger ice sheets. This means they have had a disproportionate contribution to historical sea level rise and are set to contribute a smaller, but still significant fraction of sea level rise in the 21st century.",

         "Vertical datum ==Methods== In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above sea level, although what \"sea level\" actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, tides, topography, and differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of nearby ice sheets, mountains, and density variations in the crust and deep in the mantle. For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is mean sea level (MSL). This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard \"sea level\" for all mapping and surveying in that country. (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at Newlyn in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921). *",

The scale of change during the last glacial/interglacial transition is indicated with a black bar. ]] The formation of marine terraces is controlled by changes in environmental conditions and by tectonic activity during recent geological times. Changes in climatic conditions have led to eustatic sea-level oscillations and isostatic movements of the Earth's crust, especially with the changes between glacial and interglacial periods. Processes of eustasy lead to glacioeustatic sea level fluctuations due to changes of the water volume in the oceans, and hence to regressions and transgressions of the shoreline. At times of maximum glacial extent during the last glacial period, the sea level was about lower compared to today. Eustatic sea level changes can also be caused by changes in the void volume of the oceans, either through sedimento-eustasy or tectono-eustasy. Processes of isostasy involve the uplift of continental crusts along with their shorelines. Today, the process of glacial isostatic adjustment mainly applies to Pleistocene glaciated areas. In general, eustatic marine terraces were formed during separate sea level highstands of interglacial stages and can be correlated to marine oxygen isotopic stages (MIS).

In the recent geological past, thermal expansion from increased temperatures and changes in land ice are the dominant reasons of sea level rise. The last time that the Earth was warmer than pre-industrial temperatures was 120,000 years ago. This was when warming due to Milankovitch cycles (changes in the amount of sunlight due to slow changes in the Earth's orbit) caused the Eemian interglacial. Sea levels during that warmer interglacial were at least higher than now. The Eemian warming was sustained over a period of thousands of years. The size of the rise in sea level implies a large contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Since the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 years ago, sea level has risen by more than . Rates vary from less than 1&nbsp;mm/year during the pre-industrial era to 40+ mm/year when major ice sheets over Canada and Eurasia melted. Meltwater pulses are periods of fast sea level rise caused by the rapid disintegration of these ice sheets. The rate of sea level rise started to slow down about 8,200 years before today. Sea level was almost constant for the last 2,500 years.",

         "Vertical datum ==Methods== In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above sea level, although what \"sea level\" actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, tides, topography, and differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of nearby ice sheets, mountains, and density variations in the crust and deep in the mantle. For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is mean sea level (MSL). This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard \"sea level\" for all mapping and surveying in that country. (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at Newlyn in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921). *",

         "Sea level rise 2023 modelling has narrowed the tipping threshold to a - range, which is consistent with the empirical upper limit from ice cores. If temperatures reach or exceed that level, reducing the global temperature to above pre-industrial levels or lower would prevent the loss of the entire ice sheet. One way to do this in theory would be large-scale carbon dioxide removal, but there would still be cause of greater ice losses and sea level rise from Greenland than if the threshold was not breached in the first place. If the tipping point instead is durably but mildly crossed, the ice sheet would take between 10,000 and 15,000 years to disintegrate entirely, with a most likely estimate of 10,000 years. === Mountain glacier loss === thumbupright=1.2Based on national pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, global mean temperature is projected to increase by , which would cause loss of about half of Earth's glaciers by 2100—causing a sea level rise of 115±40 millimeters. There are roughly 200,000 glaciers on Earth, which are spread out across all continents. Less than 1% of glacier ice is in mountain glaciers, compared to 99% in Greenland and Antarctica. However, this small size also makes mountain glaciers more vulnerable to melting than the larger ice sheets. This means they have had a disproportionate contribution to historical sea level rise and are set to contribute a smaller, but still significant fraction of sea level rise in the 21st century.",

If the AMO were responsible for SST variability, the AMOC would have increased in strength, which is apparently not the case. Furthermore, it is clear from statistical analyses of annual tropical cyclones that these changes do not display multidecadal cyclicity. The ocean mixed layer plays an important role in heat storage over seasonal and decadal time scales, whereas deeper layers are affected over millennia and have a heat capacity about 50 times that of the mixed layer. This heat uptake provides a time-lag for climate change but it also results in thermal expansion of the oceans which contributes to sea level rise. 21st-century global warming will probably result in an equilibrium sea-level rise five times greater than today, whilst melting of glaciers, including that of the Greenland ice sheet, expected to have virtually no effect during the 21st century, will likely result in a sea-level rise of over a millennium. == Theories of natural delimitation between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans == thumb300pxrightMap showing the proposal presented by the thesis entitled \"[[Natural delimitation between the Pacific and South Atlantic oceans by the Shackleton Fracture Zone\"]] Scientific researchers have proposed delimiting the boundary between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by two different natural boundaries, by the Shackleton fracture zone and by the Scotia Arc the former being more current than the latter.",

Enele Sopoaga, the prime minister of Tuvalu at the time, responded to the research by stating that Tuvalu is not expanding and has gained no additional habitable land. Sopoaga has also said that evacuating the islands is the last resort. Whether there are measurable changes in the sea level relative to the islands of Tuvalu is a contentious issue. There were problems associated with the pre-1993 sea level records from Funafuti which resulted in improvements in the recording technology to provide more reliable data for analysis. The 2011 report of the ''Pacific Climate Change Science Program'' published by the Australian Government, concludes: \"The sea-level rise near Tuvalu measured by satellite altimeters since 1993 is about per year.\" Tuvalu has adopted a national plan of action as the observable transformations over the last ten to fifteen years show Tuvaluans that there have been changes to the sea levels.

In Guyana much of the capital Georgetown is already below sea level. In Brazil, the coastal ecoregion of Caatinga is responsible for 99% of its shrimp production. A combination of sea level rise, ocean warming and ocean acidification threaten its unique ecosystem. Extreme wave or wind behavior disrupted the port complex of Santa Catarina 76 times in one 6-year period in the 2010s. There was a US$25,000–50,000 loss for each idle day.

In the recent geological past, thermal expansion from increased temperatures and changes in land ice are the dominant reasons of sea level rise. The last time that the Earth was warmer than pre-industrial temperatures was 120,000 years ago. This was when warming due to Milankovitch cycles (changes in the amount of sunlight due to slow changes in the Earth's orbit) caused the Eemian interglacial. Sea levels during that warmer interglacial were at least higher than now. The Eemian warming was sustained over a period of thousands of years. The size of the rise in sea level implies a large contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Since the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 years ago, sea level has risen by more than . Rates vary from less than 1&nbsp;mm/year during the pre-industrial era to 40+ mm/year when major ice sheets over Canada and Eurasia melted. Meltwater pulses are periods of fast sea level rise caused by the rapid disintegration of these ice sheets. The rate of sea level rise started to slow down about 8,200 years before today. Sea level was almost constant for the last 2,500 years.",

         "Vertical datum ==Methods== In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above sea level, although what \"sea level\" actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, tides, topography, and differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of nearby ice sheets, mountains, and density variations in the crust and deep in the mantle. For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is mean sea level (MSL). This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard \"sea level\" for all mapping and surveying in that country. (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at Newlyn in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921). *",

In the recent geological past, thermal expansion from increased temperatures and changes in land ice are the dominant reasons of sea level rise. The last time that the Earth was warmer than pre-industrial temperatures was 120,000 years ago. This was when warming due to Milankovitch cycles (changes in the amount of sunlight due to slow changes in the Earth's orbit) caused the Eemian interglacial. Sea levels during that warmer interglacial were at least higher than now. The Eemian warming was sustained over a period of thousands of years. The size of the rise in sea level implies a large contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Since the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 years ago, sea level has risen by more than . Rates vary from less than 1&nbsp;mm/year during the pre-industrial era to 40+ mm/year when major ice sheets over Canada and Eurasia melted. Meltwater pulses are periods of fast sea level rise caused by the rapid disintegration of these ice sheets. The rate of sea level rise started to slow down about 8,200 years before today.

         "Pangaea Proxima In the next 50 million years (assuming no new subduction zones come into being before then), North America is predicted to shift west and Eurasia east, and possibly even to the south, bringing Great Britain closer to the North Pole and Siberia southward towards warm, subtropical latitudes. Africa is predicted to collide with Europe and Arabia, closing the Mediterranean Sea (thus completely closing the Tethys Ocean (or Neotethys)) and the Red Sea between Sudan and Saudi Arabia while the Persian Gulf will be closed off resulting in Iran to become a landlocked country. A long mountain range (the Mediterranean Mountain Range) would then extend from Iberia, across Southern Europe and into Asia. Some are even predicted to have peaks higher than Mount Everest between Spain, Greece, Italy, and Egypt. Similarly, Australia is predicted to beach itself past the doorstep of Southeast Asia, causing islands such as the Philippines and Indonesia to be compressed inland, forming another potential mountain range while Japan will collide with China, Korea, and Russia. Meanwhile, Southern and Baja California are predicted to have already collided with Alaska with new mountain ranges formed between the United States and Canada. About 125 million years from now, the Atlantic Ocean is predicted to stop widening and begin to shrink as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge seafloor spreading gives way to subduction.",

         "Sea level rise 2023 modelling has narrowed the tipping threshold to a - range, which is consistent with the empirical upper limit from ice cores. If temperatures reach or exceed that level, reducing the global temperature to above pre-industrial levels or lower would prevent the loss of the entire ice sheet. One way to do this in theory would be large-scale carbon dioxide removal, but there would still be cause of greater ice losses and sea level rise from Greenland than if the threshold was not breached in the first place. If the tipping point instead is durably but mildly crossed, the ice sheet would take between 10,000 and 15,000 years to disintegrate entirely, with a most likely estimate of 10,000 years. === Mountain glacier loss === thumbupright=1.2Based on national pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, global mean temperature is projected to increase by , which would cause loss of about half of Earth's glaciers by 2100—causing a sea level rise of 115±40 millimeters. There are roughly 200,000 glaciers on Earth, which are spread out across all continents. Less than 1% of glacier ice is in mountain glaciers, compared to 99% in Greenland and Antarctica. However, this small size also makes mountain glaciers more vulnerable to melting than the larger ice sheets. This means they have had a disproportionate contribution to historical sea level rise and are set to contribute a smaller, but still significant fraction of sea level rise in the 21st century.",

         "Vertical datum ==Methods== In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above sea level, although what \"sea level\" actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, tides, topography, and differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of nearby ice sheets, mountains, and density variations in the crust and deep in the mantle. For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is mean sea level (MSL). This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard \"sea level\" for all mapping and surveying in that country. (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at Newlyn in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921). *",

In the recent geological past, thermal expansion from increased temperatures and changes in land ice are the dominant reasons of sea level rise. The last time that the Earth was warmer than pre-industrial temperatures was 120,000 years ago. This was when warming due to Milankovitch cycles (changes in the amount of sunlight due to slow changes in the Earth's orbit) caused the Eemian interglacial. Sea levels during that warmer interglacial were at least higher than now. The Eemian warming was sustained over a period of thousands of years. The size of the rise in sea level implies a large contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Since the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 years ago, sea level has risen by more than . Rates vary from less than 1&nbsp;mm/year during the pre-industrial era to 40+ mm/year when major ice sheets over Canada and Eurasia melted. Meltwater pulses are periods of fast sea level rise caused by the rapid disintegration of these ice sheets. The rate of sea level rise started to slow down about 8,200 years before today.

Some are even predicted to have peaks higher than Mount Everest between Spain, Greece, Italy, and Egypt. Similarly, Australia is predicted to beach itself past the doorstep of Southeast Asia, causing islands such as the Philippines and Indonesia to be compressed inland, forming another potential mountain range while Japan will collide with China, Korea, and Russia. Meanwhile, Southern and Baja California are predicted to have already collided with Alaska with new mountain ranges formed between the United States and Canada.

         "Sea level rise 2023 modelling has narrowed the tipping threshold to a - range, which is consistent with the empirical upper limit from ice cores. If temperatures reach or exceed that level, reducing the global temperature to above pre-industrial levels or lower would prevent the loss of the entire ice sheet. One way to do this in theory would be large-scale carbon dioxide removal, but there would still be cause of greater ice losses and sea level rise from Greenland than if the threshold was not breached in the first place. If the tipping point instead is durably but mildly crossed, the ice sheet would take between 10,000 and 15,000 years to disintegrate entirely, with a most likely estimate of 10,000 years. === Mountain glacier loss === thumbupright=1.2Based on national pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, global mean temperature is projected to increase by , which would cause loss of about half of Earth's glaciers by 2100—causing a sea level rise of 115±40 millimeters. There are roughly 200,000 glaciers on Earth, which are spread out across all continents. Less than 1% of glacier ice is in mountain glaciers, compared to 99% in Greenland and Antarctica. However, this small size also makes mountain glaciers more vulnerable to melting than the larger ice sheets.

         "Vertical datum ==Methods== In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above sea level, although what \"sea level\" actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, tides, topography, and differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of nearby ice sheets, mountains, and density variations in the crust and deep in the mantle. For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is mean sea level (MSL). This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard \"sea level\" for all mapping and surveying in that country. (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at Newlyn in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921). *",

The scale of change during the last glacial/interglacial transition is indicated with a black bar. ]] The formation of marine terraces is controlled by changes in environmental conditions and by tectonic activity during recent geological times. Changes in climatic conditions have led to eustatic sea-level oscillations and isostatic movements of the Earth's crust, especially with the changes between glacial and interglacial periods. Processes of eustasy lead to glacioeustatic sea level fluctuations due to changes of the water volume in the oceans, and hence to regressions and transgressions of the shoreline. At times of maximum glacial extent during the last glacial period, the sea level was about lower compared to today. Eustatic sea level changes can also be caused by changes in the void volume of the oceans, either through sedimento-eustasy or tectono-eustasy. Processes of isostasy involve the uplift of continental crusts along with their shorelines. Today, the process of glacial isostatic adjustment mainly applies to Pleistocene glaciated areas. In general, eustatic marine terraces were formed during separate sea level highstands of interglacial stages and can be correlated to marine oxygen isotopic stages (MIS).

It is clear that the ocean is warming as a result of climate change, and this rate of warming is increasing. This is determined by the ocean heat content, which exceeded the previous 2021 maximum in 2022. The majority of ocean heat gain occurs in the Southern Ocean. For example, between the 1950s and the 1980s, the temperature of the Antarctic Southern Ocean rose by 0.17&nbsp;°C (0.31&nbsp;°F), nearly twice the rate of the global ocean. The warming rate varies with depth. The upper ocean (above 700 m) is warming the fastest. At an ocean depth of a thousand metres the warming occurs at a rate of nearly 0.4&nbsp;°C per century (data from 1981 to 2019). Bering Sea snow crab populations declined 84% between 2018 and 2022, a loss of 9.8 billion crabs. ==== Ocean heat content ==== The ocean temperature varies from place to place.

In the recent geological past, thermal expansion from increased temperatures and changes in land ice are the dominant reasons of sea level rise. The last time that the Earth was warmer than pre-industrial temperatures was 120,000 years ago. This was when warming due to Milankovitch cycles (changes in the amount of sunlight due to slow changes in the Earth's orbit) caused the Eemian interglacial. Sea levels during that warmer interglacial were at least higher than now. The Eemian warming was sustained over a period of thousands of years. The size of the rise in sea level implies a large contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Since the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 years ago, sea level has risen by more than . Rates vary from less than 1&nbsp;mm/year during the pre-industrial era to 40+ mm/year when major ice sheets over Canada and Eurasia melted. Meltwater pulses are periods of fast sea level rise caused by the rapid disintegration of these ice sheets. The rate of sea level rise started to slow down about 8,200 years before today.

         "Vertical datum ==Methods== In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above sea level, although what \"sea level\" actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, tides, topography, and differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of nearby ice sheets, mountains, and density variations in the crust and deep in the mantle. For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is mean sea level (MSL). This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard \"sea level\" for all mapping and surveying in that country. (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at Newlyn in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921). *",

One way to do this in theory would be large-scale carbon dioxide removal, but there would still be cause of greater ice losses and sea level rise from Greenland than if the threshold was not breached in the first place.

         "Atlantic Ocean In 2024, the research highlighted a significant weakening of the AMOC by approximately 12% over the past two decades. If the AMO were responsible for SST variability, the AMOC would have increased in strength, which is apparently not the case. Furthermore, it is clear from statistical analyses of annual tropical cyclones that these changes do not display multidecadal cyclicity. The ocean mixed layer plays an important role in heat storage over seasonal and decadal time scales, whereas deeper layers are affected over millennia and have a heat capacity about 50 times that of the mixed layer. This heat uptake provides a time-lag for climate change but it also results in thermal expansion of the oceans which contributes to sea level rise. 21st-century global warming will probably result in an equilibrium sea-level rise five times greater than today, whilst melting of glaciers, including that of the Greenland ice sheet, expected to have virtually no effect during the 21st century, will likely result in a sea-level rise of over a millennium. == Theories of natural delimitation between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans == thumb300pxrightMap showing the proposal presented by the thesis entitled \"[[Natural delimitation between the Pacific and South Atlantic oceans by the Shackleton Fracture Zone\"]] Scientific researchers have proposed delimiting the boundary between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by two different natural boundaries, by the Shackleton fracture zone and by the Scotia Arc the former being more current than the latter.",

A study published in 2018 estimated the change in land area of Tuvalu's nine atolls and 101 reef islands between 1971 and 2014, indicating that 75% of the islands had grown in area, with an overall increase of more than 2%. Enele Sopoaga, the prime minister of Tuvalu at the time, responded to the research by stating that Tuvalu is not expanding and has gained no additional habitable land. Sopoaga has also said that evacuating the islands is the last resort. Whether there are measurable changes in the sea level relative to the islands of Tuvalu is a contentious issue. There were problems associated with the pre-1993 sea level records from Funafuti which resulted in improvements in the recording technology to provide more reliable data for analysis. The 2011 report of the ''Pacific Climate Change Science Program'' published by the Australian Government, concludes: \"The sea-level rise near Tuvalu measured by satellite altimeters since 1993 is about per year.\" Tuvalu has adopted a national plan of action as the observable transformations over the last ten to fifteen years show Tuvaluans that there have been changes to the sea levels.

In the recent geological past, thermal expansion from increased temperatures and changes in land ice are the dominant reasons of sea level rise. The last time that the Earth was warmer than pre-industrial temperatures was 120,000 years ago. This was when warming due to Milankovitch cycles (changes in the amount of sunlight due to slow changes in the Earth's orbit) caused the Eemian interglacial. Sea levels during that warmer interglacial were at least higher than now. The Eemian warming was sustained over a period of thousands of years. The size of the rise in sea level implies a large contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Since the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 years ago, sea level has risen by more than . Rates vary from less than 1&nbsp;mm/year during the pre-industrial era to 40+ mm/year when major ice sheets over Canada and Eurasia melted. Meltwater pulses are periods of fast sea level rise caused by the rapid disintegration of these ice sheets. The rate of sea level rise started to slow down about 8,200 years before today.

         "Vertical datum ==Methods== In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above sea level, although what \"sea level\" actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, tides, topography, and differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of nearby ice sheets, mountains, and density variations in the crust and deep in the mantle. For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is mean sea level (MSL). This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard \"sea level\" for all mapping and surveying in that country. (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at Newlyn in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921). *",

Atolls on average reach above sea level. These are the most vulnerable places to coastal erosion, flooding and salt intrusion into soils and freshwater caused by sea level rise. Sea level rise may make an island uninhabitable before it is completely flooded. Already, children in small island states encounter hampered access to food and water. They suffer an increased rate of mental and social disorders due to these stresses. At current rates, sea level rise would be high enough to make the Maldives uninhabitable by 2100.

         "Climate change in the United States ==== Weakened polar vortex jet stream ==== Climate scientists have hypothesised that the stratospheric polar vortex jet stream will gradually weaken as a result of global warming and thus influence U.S. conditions. This trend could possibly cause changes in the future such as increasing frost in certain areas. The magazine ''Scientific American'' noted in December 2014 that ice cover on the Great Lakes had recently \"reached its second-greatest extent on record\", showing climate variability. This opinion is shared by many climate scientists. === Sea level rise === thumb NOAA predicts different levels of sea level rise through 2050 for the various U.S. coastlines (shown), further projecting that a failure to curb future emissions could cause a total of 3.5-7 feet (1.1-2.1 m) rise by 2100. image2= 20201112 Tidal flooding graph - Annapolis, Maryland.svg caption2= Adaptation measures for tidal flooding, such as sea walls and building up roadway heights, are predicted to last only a few decades. image3=2000- Declared flood disasters - US.svg caption3= The number of floods declared to be disasters by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has increased, especially since 2010. }} Sea level rise has taken place in the U.S. for decades, going back to the 19th century. 40% of the U.S. population live near a coast, and are vulnerable to sea level rise.

Sea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth's temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. It could then reach by 2100 between and from now and approximately to from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50&nbsp;cm (1.6&nbsp;ft) or even by 1.9&nbsp;m (6.2&nbsp;ft) by 2100. Rising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines.",

In the recent geological past, thermal expansion from increased temperatures and changes in land ice are the dominant reasons of sea level rise. The last time that the Earth was warmer than pre-industrial temperatures was 120,000 years ago. This was when warming due to Milankovitch cycles (changes in the amount of sunlight due to slow changes in the Earth's orbit) caused the Eemian interglacial. Sea levels during that warmer interglacial were at least higher than now. The Eemian warming was sustained over a period of thousands of years. The size of the rise in sea level implies a large contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Since the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 years ago, sea level has risen by more than . Rates vary from less than 1&nbsp;mm/year during the pre-industrial era to 40+ mm/year when major ice sheets over Canada and Eurasia melted.

If temperatures reach or exceed that level, reducing the global temperature to above pre-industrial levels or lower would prevent the loss of the entire ice sheet. One way to do this in theory would be large-scale carbon dioxide removal, but there would still be cause of greater ice losses and sea level rise from Greenland than if the threshold was not breached in the first place. If the tipping point instead is durably but mildly crossed, the ice sheet would take between 10,000 and 15,000 years to disintegrate entirely, with a most likely estimate of 10,000 years. === Mountain glacier loss === thumbupright=1.2Based on national pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, global mean temperature is projected to increase by , which would cause loss of about half of Earth's glaciers by 2100—causing a sea level rise of 115±40 millimeters. There are roughly 200,000 glaciers on Earth, which are spread out across all continents. Less than 1% of glacier ice is in mountain glaciers, compared to 99% in Greenland and Antarctica. However, this small size also makes mountain glaciers more vulnerable to melting than the larger ice sheets.

         "Vertical datum ==Methods== In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above sea level, although what \"sea level\" actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, tides, topography, and differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of nearby ice sheets, mountains, and density variations in the crust and deep in the mantle. For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is mean sea level (MSL). This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard \"sea level\" for all mapping and surveying in that country. (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at Newlyn in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921). *",

NOAA's ''Global and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios'' said in February 2022 that relative sea level along the contiguous U.S. coastline is expected to rise on average as much over the next 30 years——as it has over the preceding 100 years. More specifically, NOAA's February 2022 ''Sea Level Rise Technical Report'' estimated that rise in the following three decades is anticipated to be, on average: 10-14 inches (0.25-0.35 m) for the East coast; 14-18 inches (0.35-0.45 m) for the Gulf coast; 4-8 inches (0.1-0.2 m) for the West coast; 8-10 inches (0.2-0.25 m) for the Caribbean; 6-8 inches (0.15-0.2 m) for the Hawaiian Islands; and 8-10 inches (0.2-0.25 m) for northern Alaska. The U.S. Geological Survey has conducted research on sea level rise, addressing coastal vulnerability, and incorporating six physical variables to analyze the changes in sea level: geomorphology, coastal slope (percent), rate of relative sea level rise (mm/yr), shoreline erosion and acceleration rates (m/yr), mean tidal range (m), and mean wave height (m). The research was conducted on the various coastline areas of the United States. Along the Pacific coast, the most vulnerable areas are low-lying beaches, and \"their susceptibility is primarily a function of geomorphology and coastal slope.\"",

In the recent geological past, thermal expansion from increased temperatures and changes in land ice are the dominant reasons of sea level rise. The last time that the Earth was warmer than pre-industrial temperatures was 120,000 years ago. This was when warming due to Milankovitch cycles (changes in the amount of sunlight due to slow changes in the Earth's orbit) caused the Eemian interglacial. Sea levels during that warmer interglacial were at least higher than now. The Eemian warming was sustained over a period of thousands of years. The size of the rise in sea level implies a large contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Since the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 years ago, sea level has risen by more than . Rates vary from less than 1&nbsp;mm/year during the pre-industrial era to 40+ mm/year when major ice sheets over Canada and Eurasia melted. Meltwater pulses are periods of fast sea level rise caused by the rapid disintegration of these ice sheets. The rate of sea level rise started to slow down about 8,200 years before today.

         "Sea level rise 2023 modelling has narrowed the tipping threshold to a - range, which is consistent with the empirical upper limit from ice cores. If temperatures reach or exceed that level, reducing the global temperature to above pre-industrial levels or lower would prevent the loss of the entire ice sheet. One way to do this in theory would be large-scale carbon dioxide removal, but there would still be cause of greater ice losses and sea level rise from Greenland than if the threshold was not breached in the first place. If the tipping point instead is durably but mildly crossed, the ice sheet would take between 10,000 and 15,000 years to disintegrate entirely, with a most likely estimate of 10,000 years. === Mountain glacier loss === thumbupright=1.2Based on national pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, global mean temperature is projected to increase by , which would cause loss of about half of Earth's glaciers by 2100—causing a sea level rise of 115±40 millimeters. There are roughly 200,000 glaciers on Earth, which are spread out across all continents. Less than 1% of glacier ice is in mountain glaciers, compared to 99% in Greenland and Antarctica. However, this small size also makes mountain glaciers more vulnerable to melting than the larger ice sheets. This means they have had a disproportionate contribution to historical sea level rise and are set to contribute a smaller, but still significant fraction of sea level rise in the 21st century.",

         "Vertical datum ==Methods== In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above sea level, although what \"sea level\" actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, tides, topography, and differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of nearby ice sheets, mountains, and density variations in the crust and deep in the mantle. For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is mean sea level (MSL). This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard \"sea level\" for all mapping and surveying in that country. (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at Newlyn in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921). *",

The scale of change during the last glacial/interglacial transition is indicated with a black bar. ]] The formation of marine terraces is controlled by changes in environmental conditions and by tectonic activity during recent geological times. Changes in climatic conditions have led to eustatic sea-level oscillations and isostatic movements of the Earth's crust, especially with the changes between glacial and interglacial periods. Processes of eustasy lead to glacioeustatic sea level fluctuations due to changes of the water volume in the oceans, and hence to regressions and transgressions of the shoreline. At times of maximum glacial extent during the last glacial period, the sea level was about lower compared to today. Eustatic sea level changes can also be caused by changes in the void volume of the oceans, either through sedimento-eustasy or tectono-eustasy. Processes of isostasy involve the uplift of continental crusts along with their shorelines. Today, the process of glacial isostatic adjustment mainly applies to Pleistocene glaciated areas. In general, eustatic marine terraces were formed during separate sea level highstands of interglacial stages and can be correlated to marine oxygen isotopic stages (MIS).

It is clear that the ocean is warming as a result of climate change, and this rate of warming is increasing. This is determined by the ocean heat content, which exceeded the previous 2021 maximum in 2022. The majority of ocean heat gain occurs in the Southern Ocean. For example, between the 1950s and the 1980s, the temperature of the Antarctic Southern Ocean rose by 0.17&nbsp;°C (0.31&nbsp;°F), nearly twice the rate of the global ocean. The warming rate varies with depth. The upper ocean (above 700 m) is warming the fastest. At an ocean depth of a thousand metres the warming occurs at a rate of nearly 0.4&nbsp;°C per century (data from 1981 to 2019). Bering Sea snow crab populations declined 84% between 2018 and 2022, a loss of 9.8 billion crabs. ==== Ocean heat content ==== The ocean temperature varies from place to place.

In the recent geological past, thermal expansion from increased temperatures and changes in land ice are the dominant reasons of sea level rise. The last time that the Earth was warmer than pre-industrial temperatures was 120,000 years ago. This was when warming due to Milankovitch cycles (changes in the amount of sunlight due to slow changes in the Earth's orbit) caused the Eemian interglacial. Sea levels during that warmer interglacial were at least higher than now. The Eemian warming was sustained over a period of thousands of years.

This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard \"sea level\" for all mapping and surveying in that country. (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at Newlyn in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921). *",

         "Sea level rise 2023 modelling has narrowed the tipping threshold to a - range, which is consistent with the empirical upper limit from ice cores. If temperatures reach or exceed that level, reducing the global temperature to above pre-industrial levels or lower would prevent the loss of the entire ice sheet. One way to do this in theory would be large-scale carbon dioxide removal, but there would still be cause of greater ice losses and sea level rise from Greenland than if the threshold was not breached in the first place. If the tipping point instead is durably but mildly crossed, the ice sheet would take between 10,000 and 15,000 years to disintegrate entirely, with a most likely estimate of 10,000 years. === Mountain glacier loss === thumbupright=1.2Based on national pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, global mean temperature is projected to increase by , which would cause loss of about half of Earth's glaciers by 2100—causing a sea level rise of 115±40 millimeters. There are roughly 200,000 glaciers on Earth, which are spread out across all continents. Less than 1% of glacier ice is in mountain glaciers, compared to 99% in Greenland and Antarctica. However, this small size also makes mountain glaciers more vulnerable to melting than the larger ice sheets.

         "Atlantic Ocean In 2024, the research highlighted a significant weakening of the AMOC by approximately 12% over the past two decades. If the AMO were responsible for SST variability, the AMOC would have increased in strength, which is apparently not the case. Furthermore, it is clear from statistical analyses of annual tropical cyclones that these changes do not display multidecadal cyclicity. The ocean mixed layer plays an important role in heat storage over seasonal and decadal time scales, whereas deeper layers are affected over millennia and have a heat capacity about 50 times that of the mixed layer. This heat uptake provides a time-lag for climate change but it also results in thermal expansion of the oceans which contributes to sea level rise. 21st-century global warming will probably result in an equilibrium sea-level rise five times greater than today, whilst melting of glaciers, including that of the Greenland ice sheet, expected to have virtually no effect during the 21st century, will likely result in a sea-level rise of over a millennium. == Theories of natural delimitation between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans == thumb300pxrightMap showing the proposal presented by the thesis entitled \"[[Natural delimitation between the Pacific and South Atlantic oceans by the Shackleton Fracture Zone\"]] Scientific researchers have proposed delimiting the boundary between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by two different natural boundaries, by the Shackleton fracture zone and by the Scotia Arc the former being more current than the latter.",

Sopoaga has also said that evacuating the islands is the last resort. Whether there are measurable changes in the sea level relative to the islands of Tuvalu is a contentious issue. There were problems associated with the pre-1993 sea level records from Funafuti which resulted in improvements in the recording technology to provide more reliable data for analysis.

With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50&nbsp;cm (1.6&nbsp;ft) or even by 1.9&nbsp;m (6.2&nbsp;ft) by 2100. Rising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines.",

In the recent geological past, thermal expansion from increased temperatures and changes in land ice are the dominant reasons of sea level rise. The last time that the Earth was warmer than pre-industrial temperatures was 120,000 years ago. This was when warming due to Milankovitch cycles (changes in the amount of sunlight due to slow changes in the Earth's orbit) caused the Eemian interglacial. Sea levels during that warmer interglacial were at least higher than now. The Eemian warming was sustained over a period of thousands of years. The size of the rise in sea level implies a large contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Since the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 years ago, sea level has risen by more than . Rates vary from less than 1&nbsp;mm/year during the pre-industrial era to 40+ mm/year when major ice sheets over Canada and Eurasia melted. Meltwater pulses are periods of fast sea level rise caused by the rapid disintegration of these ice sheets. The rate of sea level rise started to slow down about 8,200 years before today. Sea level was almost constant for the last 2,500 years.",

         "Vertical datum ==Methods== In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above sea level, although what \"sea level\" actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, tides, topography, and differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of nearby ice sheets, mountains, and density variations in the crust and deep in the mantle. For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is mean sea level (MSL). This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard \"sea level\" for all mapping and surveying in that country. (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at Newlyn in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921). *",

         "Greenhouse A prominent design from the 19th century were glasshouses with sufficient height for sizeable trees, called palm houses. These were normally in public gardens or parks and exemplified the 19th-century development of glass and iron architecture. This technology was widely used in railway stations, markets, exhibition halls, and other large buildings that needed large, open internal area. One of the earliest examples of a palm house is in the Belfast Botanic Gardens. Designed by Charles Lanyon, the building was completed in 1840. It was constructed by iron-maker Richard Turner, who would later build the Palm House, Kew Gardens at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London, in 1848. This came shortly after the Chatsworth Great Conservatory (1837–40) and shortly before The Crystal Palace (1851), both designed by Joseph Paxton, and both now lost. Other large greenhouses built in the 19th century included the New York Crystal Palace, Munich's Glaspalast and the Royal Greenhouses of Laeken (1874–1895) for King Leopold II of Belgium. In Japan, the first greenhouse was built in 1880 by Samuel Cocking, a British merchant who exported herbs. ===20th century=== thumbThe [[Eden Project, in Cornwall, England]] thumbA plastic air-insulated greenhouse in [[New Zealand]] thumbGiant greenhouses in [[Westland (region), NetherlandsWestland, the Netherlands]] In the 20th century, the geodesic dome was added to the many types of greenhouses.

Players begin the game by building a profile including variables such as water use and transportation behaviors, heating and cooling practices, food purchases, and electrical appliance usage. Once the profile has been built, the player can begin the simulation which introduces different scenarios ranging from heat waves to mad cow disease. The player adjusts their lifestyle according to how they would react to these events in real life.

While industry is commonly cited as the source of these emissions, emissions are ultimately a matter of end-use and therefore lifestyle. That is, when a product is chosen, so is a production process.

The first step of processing CFLs involves crushing the bulbs in a machine that uses negative pressure ventilation and a mercury-absorbing filter or cold trap to contain mercury vapor. Many municipalities are purchasing such machines. The crushed glass and metal is stored in drums, ready for shipping to recycling factories. === Greenhouse gases === In some places, such as Quebec and British Columbia in 2007, central heating for homes was provided mostly by the burning of natural gas, whereas electricity was primarily provided by hydroelectric power. An analysis of the impacts of a ban on incandescent light bulbs at that time introduced the notion that in such areas, heat generated by conventional electric light bulbs may have been significantly reducing the release of greenhouse gases from natural gas heating. Ivanco, Karney, and Waher estimated that \"If all homes in Quebec were required to switch from (incandescent) bulbs to CFLs, there would be an increase of almost 220,000 tonnes in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the province, equivalent to the annual emissions from more than 40,000 automobiles.\" == Use and adoption == thumbuprightAn E27 Philips 5 watt CFL220px CFLs are produced for both alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) input.

         "Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere In 2013, the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> was estimated to be responsible for 1.82 W m<sup>−2</sup> of the 2.63 W m<sup>−2</sup> change in radiative forcing on Earth (about 70%). Earth's natural greenhouse effect makes life as we know it possible, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plays a significant role in providing for the relatively high temperature on Earth. The greenhouse effect is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary atmosphere warms the planet's surface beyond the temperature it would have in the absence of its atmosphere. The concept of more atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increasing ground temperature was first published by Svante Arrhenius in 1896. The increased radiative forcing due to increased CO<sub>2</sub> in the Earth's atmosphere is based on the physical properties of CO<sub>2</sub> and the non-saturated absorption windows where CO<sub>2</sub> absorbs outgoing long-wave energy. The increased forcing drives further changes in Earth's energy balance and, over the longer term, in Earth's climate. ]] Atmospheric carbon dioxide plays an integral role in the Earth's carbon cycle whereby is removed from the atmosphere by some natural processes such as photosynthesis and deposition of carbonates, to form limestones for example, and added back to the atmosphere by other natural processes such as respiration and the acid dissolution of carbonate deposits. There are two broad carbon cycles on Earth: the fast carbon cycle and the slow carbon cycle.",

         "Air pollution In the atmosphere, ammonia reacts with oxides of nitrogen and sulfur to form secondary particles. === Carbon dioxide === Carbon dioxide () is mainly emitted by the burning of fossil fuels. It is potentially lethal at very high concentrations (typically 100 times \"normal\" atmospheric levels). Although the World Health Organization recognizes as a climate pollutant, it does not include the gas in its ''Air Quality Guidelines'' or set recommended targets for it. Workplace exposure limits exist in places like UK (5,000 ppm for long-term exposure and 15,000 ppm for short-term exposure). is sometimes called an air pollutant, because it is the main greenhouse gas responsible for climate change. This question of terminology has practical consequences, for example, in determining whether the U.S. Clean Air Act (which is designed to improve air quality) is deemed to regulate emissions. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 amended the Clean Air Act to define from fossil fuel burning explicitly as an air pollutant. === Carbon monoxide === Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, toxic gas. It is a product of combustion of fuel such as natural gas, coal or wood. In the past, emissions from vehicles were the main source of CO, but modern vehicles do not emit much CO. Now, wildfires and bonfires are the main source of outdoors CO. Indoors, CO is a larger problem and mainly comes from cooking and heating.",

         "Artificial photosynthesis However, it is unclear if food production mechanisms based on the experimental process are viable and can be scaled. ==Some advantages, disadvantages, and efficiency== A concern usually addressed in catalyst design is efficiency, in particular how much of the incident light can be used in a system in practice. This is comparable with photosynthetic efficiency, where light-to-chemical-energy conversion is measured. Photosynthetic organisms are able to collect about 50% of incident solar radiation, however the theoretical limit of photosynthetic efficiency is 4.6 and 6.0% for C3 and C4 plants respectively. In reality, the efficiency of photosynthesis is much lower and is usually below 1%, with some exceptions such as sugarcane in tropical climate. In contrast, the highest reported efficiency for artificial photosynthesis lab prototypes is 22.4%. However, plants are efficient in using CO<sub>2</sub> at atmospheric concentrations, something that artificial catalysts still cannot perform. == See also == * Bacteriorhodopsin * ATP synthase * Photoelectrochemistry * AlgaePARC * Carbon footprint * Fuel cell * Hydrogen economy * List of emerging technologies * Metabolic engineering *Photosensitizer * CityTrees *Liquid3 *Solar reforming == References == == External links == * [ Engineering light-activated metalloproteins to split water] at Australia National University * [ Daniel Nocera describes new process for storing solar energy] at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. *[ Paul Alivisatos on Artificial Photosynthesis] at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory *[ Nanocapsules for artificial photosynthesis] a Nanowerk News article *[ MIT Solar Revolution Project] Category:Hydrogen production Category:Photochemistry Category:Renewable energy technology Category:Fuel production",

         "Carbon tech '''Carbon tech''' is a group of existing and emerging technologies that are rapidly transforming oil and gas to low emissions energy. Combined, these technologies take a circular carbon economy approach for managing and reducing carbon footprints, while optimizing biological and industry processes. It is built on the principles of the circular economy for managing carbon emissions: to reduce the amount of carbon emissions entering the atmosphere, to reuse carbon emissions as a feedstock in different industries, to recycle carbon through the natural carbon cycle with bio energy, and to remove carbon and store it. Carbon tech provides a third option for climate and environmental policy as an alternate to the binary ''business as usual'' and ''radical change''. Carbon management can be achieved through nature-based solutions such as reforestation and afforestation, or through technological strategies. Technologies available range from Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS), to negative emissions technologies such as bio energy with carbon capture and storage, direct air carbon capture, as well as enhanced weathering, bio fuel, and biochar from waste that exists in today's processes. ==Principles== The circular carbon economy is a closed loop system that encompasses 4Rs - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Remove and applies them to managing carbon emissions. ===Reduce=== Energy efficiency, flaring minimization, modern SCADA controls, artificial intelligence, and making consumer products greener are among the strategies used to control the anthropogenic release of carbon emissions.",

According to a report issued by the UN Environment Programme, “''the increase in HFC emissions is projected to offset much of the climate benefit achieved by the earlier reduction in the emissions of Ozone depleting substances''”. Among non-HFC refrigerants found to successfully replace the traditional ones are ammonia, hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide. ==== Ammonia ==== The history of refrigeration began with the use of ammonia.

While deaths caused by ammonia exposure are extremely rare, the scientific community has come up with safer and technologically solid mechanisms of preventing ammonia leakage in modern refrigerating equipment.

According to Skeptical Science: <blockquote>\"it is not possible to increase productivity, increase numbers of cattle and store carbon using any grazing strategy, never-mind Holistic Management [.] Long term studies on the effect of grazing on soil carbon storage have been done before, and the results are not promising. [.] Because of the complex nature of carbon storage in soils, increasing global temperature, risk of desertification and methane emissions from livestock, it is unlikely that Holistic Management, or any management technique, can reverse climate change. \"</blockquote> Commenting on his TED talk \"How to Fight Desertification and Reverse Climate Change\", Savory has since denied claiming that holistic grazing can reverse climate change, saying that “I have only used the words address climate change… although I have written and talked about reversing man-made desertification”.

         "Vertical farming A 2018 study estimated that the value of four ecosystem services provided by existing vegetation in urban areas was on the order of $33 billion annually. The study's quantitative framework projected annual food production of 100–180 million tonnes, energy savings ranging from 14 to 15 billion kilowatt-hours, nitrogen sequestration between 100,000 and 170,000 tonnes and stormwater runoff reductions between 45 and 57 billion cubic metres annually. Food production, nitrogen fixation, energy savings, pollination, climate regulation, soil formation and biological pest control could be worth as much as $80–160 billion annually. ===Reduced need for farmland=== It is estimated that by the year 2050, the world's population will increase by 3 billion people and close to 80% will live in urban areas. Vertical farms have the potential to reduce or eliminate the need to create additional farmland. ===Increased crop production=== Unlike traditional farming in non-tropical areas, indoor farming can produce crops year-round. All-season farming multiplies the productivity of the farmed surface by a factor of 4 to 6 depending on the crop. With crops such as strawberries, the factor may be as high as 30. Furthermore, as the crops would be consumed where they are grown, long-distance transport with its accompanying time delays, should reduce spoilage, infestation and energy needs.",

Schlesinger == Work with desert ecosystems, 1991-2006 == Schlesinger served as the co-principal investigator for the Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) located in the Chihuahuan Desert in southern New Mexico. Research projects mainly focus on inorganic fluxes, including studies of ammonia volatilization from soils, hydrology natural runoff plots and transect soil water content. He has also worked extensively in arid ecosystems and landscapes, studying responses to resource redistribution and global change, which can lead to soil degradation and regional desertification. Schlesinger postulated that the patchy distribution of vegetation in desert regions controls many aspects of soil fertility and the response of deserts to overgrazing and climate change. == Forest-atmosphere carbon transfer and storage, 1996-1999 == Schlesinger was the co-principal investigator for the Free Air CO<sub>2</sub> Enrichment (FACE) Experiment in the Duke Forest. The object of the study was to investigate the efficacy of carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems (vegetation and soil) in response to elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, as a means to mitigate the potential for global warming. During this decade-long experiment, Schlesinger and John Lichter (Bowdoin College) found only small changes in soil carbon content, suggesting that enhanced carbon storage in soils is unlikely to play a major role in slowing the growth of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and the magnitude of global climate change. Much larger changes were seen in the growth rate of trees, but even those were unlikely to sequester a significant increment of carbon worldwide as a result of rising CO<sub>2</sub> in Earth’s atmosphere.",

         "Tropical horticulture thumb185px[[Latex being collected from an incised rubber tree (''Hevea brasiliensis''), and a bucket of collected latex]] '''Tropical horticulture''' is a branch of horticulture that studies and cultivates plants in the tropics, i.e., the equatorial regions of the world. The field is sometimes known by the portmanteau \"TropHort\". == Overview == Tropical horticulture includes plants such as perennial woody plants (arboriculture), ornamentals (floriculture), vegetables (olericulture), and fruits (pomology) including grapes (viticulture). The origin of many of these crops is not in the tropics but in temperate zones. Their adoption to tropical climatic conditions is an objective of breeding. Many important crops, however, are indigenous to the tropics. The latter embrace perennial crops such as oil palm, vegetables including okra, field crops such as rice and sugarcane, and particularly fruits including pineapple, banana, papaya, and mango. Since the tropics represent 36 percent of the Earth's surface and 20 percent of its land surface, the potential of tropical horticulture is huge. In contrast to temperate regions, environmental conditions in the tropics are defined less by seasonal temperature fluctuations and more by seasonality of precipitation. Thus the climate in the greater part of the tropics is characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons, although such variation is reduced in locations closer to the equator (±5° latitude).",

         "Agriculture in Nepal In trying to increase agricultural production and diversify the agricultural base, the government focused on irrigation, the use of fertilizers and insecticides, the introduction of new implements and new seeds of high-yield varieties, and the provision of credit. The lack of distribution of these inputs, as well as problems in obtaining supplies, however, inhibited progress. Although land reclamation and settlement were occurring in the Terai Region, environmental degradation and ecological imbalance resulting from deforestation also prevented progress. Although new agricultural technologies helped increase food production, there still was room for further growth. Past experience indicated bottlenecks, however, in using modern technology to achieve a healthy growth. The conflicting goals of producing cash crops both for food and for industrial inputs also were problematic. ==History== The production of crops fluctuated widely as a result of these factors as well as weather conditions. Although agricultural production grew at an average annual rate of 2.4 percent from 1974 to 1989, it did not keep pace with population growth, which increased at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent over the same period. Further, the annual average growth rate of food grain production was only 1.2 percent during the same period. There were some successes. Fertile lands in the Terai Region and hardworking peasants in the Hill Region provided greater supplies of food staples (mostly rice and corn), increasing the daily caloric intake of the population locally to over 2,000 calories per capita in 1988 from about 1,900 per capita in 1965.",

         "Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere In 2013, the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> was estimated to be responsible for 1.82 W m<sup>−2</sup> of the 2.63 W m<sup>−2</sup> change in radiative forcing on Earth (about 70%). Earth's natural greenhouse effect makes life as we know it possible, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plays a significant role in providing for the relatively high temperature on Earth. The greenhouse effect is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary atmosphere warms the planet's surface beyond the temperature it would have in the absence of its atmosphere. The concept of more atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increasing ground temperature was first published by Svante Arrhenius in 1896. The increased radiative forcing due to increased CO<sub>2</sub> in the Earth's atmosphere is based on the physical properties of CO<sub>2</sub> and the non-saturated absorption windows where CO<sub>2</sub> absorbs outgoing long-wave energy. The increased forcing drives further changes in Earth's energy balance and, over the longer term, in Earth's climate. ]] Atmospheric carbon dioxide plays an integral role in the Earth's carbon cycle whereby is removed from the atmosphere by some natural processes such as photosynthesis and deposition of carbonates, to form limestones for example, and added back to the atmosphere by other natural processes such as respiration and the acid dissolution of carbonate deposits.

         "Carbon farming thumbMeasuring [[soil respiration on agricultural land. Carbon farming enhances carbon sequestration in the soil. ]] '''Carbon farming''' is a set of agricultural methods that aim to store carbon in the soil, crop roots, wood and leaves. The technical term for this is ''carbon sequestration''. The overall goal of carbon farming is to create a net loss of carbon from the atmosphere. This is done by increasing the rate at which carbon is sequestered into soil and plant material. One option is to increase the soil's organic matter content. This can also aid plant growth, improve soil water retention capacity and reduce fertilizer use. Sustainable forest management is another tool that is used in carbon farming. Carbon farming is one component of climate-smart agriculture. It is also one way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Agricultural methods for carbon farming include adjusting how tillage and livestock grazing is done, using organic mulch or compost, working with biochar and terra preta, and changing the crop types. Methods used in forestry include reforestation and bamboo farming. Carbon farming methods might have additional costs. Some countries have government policies that give financial incentives to farmers to use carbon farming methods. As of 2016, variants of carbon farming reached hundreds of millions of hectares globally, of the nearly of world farmland. Carbon farming has some disadvantages because some of its methods can affect ecosystem services. For example, carbon farming could cause an increase of land clearing, monocultures and biodiversity loss.",

         "Blue carbon Declines in vegetated coastal habitats are seen worldwide. Quantifying rates of decrease are difficult to calculate, however measurements have been estimated by researchers indicating that if blue carbon ecosystems continue to decline, for any number of reasons, 30-40% of tidal marshes and seagrasses and approximately 100% of mangroves could be gone in the next century. Reasons for the decline of mangroves, seagrass, and marshes include land use changes, climate and drought related effects, dams built in the watershed, convergence to aquaculture and agriculture, land development and sea-level rise due to climate change. Increases in these activities can lead to significant decreases in habitat availability and thus increases in released C from sediments. As anthropogenic effects and climate change are heightened, the effectiveness of blue carbon sinks will diminish and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will be further increased. Data on the rates at which CO<sub>2</sub> is being released into the atmosphere is not robust currently; however, research is being conducted to gather better information to analyze trends. Loss of underground biomass (roots and rhizomes) will allow for CO<sub>2</sub> to be emitted changing these habitats into sources rather than carbon sinks. ===Impacts of nutrient load=== Increases in carbon capture and sequestration have been observed in both mangrove and seagrass ecosystems which have been subjected to high nutrient loads, either intentionally or due to waste from human activities.",

According to Skeptical Science: <blockquote>\"it is not possible to increase productivity, increase numbers of cattle and store carbon using any grazing strategy, never-mind Holistic Management [.] Long term studies on the effect of grazing on soil carbon storage have been done before, and the results are not promising.

Also, perennial crops avoid the yearly tillage procedures (plowing, digging) associated with growing annual crops. Tilling helps the soil microbe populations to decompose the available carbon, producing CO<sub>2</sub>. Fundamentally, the below-ground carbon accumulation works as a greenhouse gas mitigation tool because it removes carbon from the above-ground carbon circulation (the circulation from plant to atmosphere and back into new plants.) The above-ground circulation is driven by photosynthesis and combustion—first, a plant absorb CO<sub>2</sub> and assimilates it as carbon in its tissue both above and below ground. When the above-ground carbon is harvested and then burned, the CO<sub>2</sub> molecule is formed yet again and released back into the atmosphere. Then, an equivalent amount of CO<sub>2</sub> is absorbed back by next season's growth, and the cycle repeats. This above-ground cycle has the potential to be carbon neutral, but of course the human involvement in operating and guiding the cycle means additional energy input, often coming from fossil sources.",

Carbon, as it relates to the organic matter of soils, is a major component of soil and catchment health. Several factors affect the variation that exists in soil organic matter and soil carbon; the most significant has, in contemporary times, been the influence of humans and agricultural systems. Although exact quantities are difficult to measure, human activities have caused massive losses of soil organic carbon. The greatest contemporary influence has been that of humans; for example, carbon in Australian agricultural soils may historically have been twice the present range that is typically 1.6–4.6%. It has long been encouraged that farmers adjust practices to maintain or increase the organic component in the soil. On one hand, practices that hasten oxidation of carbon (such as burning crop stubbles or over-cultivation) are discouraged; on the other hand, incorporation of organic material (such as in manuring) has been encouraged. Increasing soil carbon is not a straightforward matter; it is made complex by the relative activity of soil biota, which can consume and release carbon and are made more active by the addition of nitrogen fertilizers. pp.&nbsp;439–450), a comparison of national data with modelled data is performed.

         "Agriculture in Nepal In trying to increase agricultural production and diversify the agricultural base, the government focused on irrigation, the use of fertilizers and insecticides, the introduction of new implements and new seeds of high-yield varieties, and the provision of credit. The lack of distribution of these inputs, as well as problems in obtaining supplies, however, inhibited progress. Although land reclamation and settlement were occurring in the Terai Region, environmental degradation and ecological imbalance resulting from deforestation also prevented progress. Although new agricultural technologies helped increase food production, there still was room for further growth. Past experience indicated bottlenecks, however, in using modern technology to achieve a healthy growth. The conflicting goals of producing cash crops both for food and for industrial inputs also were problematic. ==History== The production of crops fluctuated widely as a result of these factors as well as weather conditions. Although agricultural production grew at an average annual rate of 2.4 percent from 1974 to 1989, it did not keep pace with population growth, which increased at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent over the same period. Further, the annual average growth rate of food grain production was only 1.2 percent during the same period. There were some successes. Fertile lands in the Terai Region and hardworking peasants in the Hill Region provided greater supplies of food staples (mostly rice and corn), increasing the daily caloric intake of the population locally to over 2,000 calories per capita in 1988 from about 1,900 per capita in 1965.",

         "Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture Livestock are responsible for 14.5% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. One cow alone will emit 220 pounds of methane per year. While the residence time of methane is much shorter than that of carbon dioxide, it is 28 times more capable of trapping heat. Traditional rice cultivation is the second biggest agricultural methane source after livestock, with a near-term warming impact equivalent to the carbon dioxide emissions from all aviation. Government involvement in agricultural policy is limited due to the high demand for agricultural products like corn, wheat, and milk. The United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) global hunger and food security initiative, the Feed the Future project, is addressing food loss and waste. By addressing food loss and waste, greenhouse gas emission mitigation is also addressed. By only focusing on dairy systems of 20 value chains in 12 countries, food loss and waste could be reduced by 4-10%. These numbers are impactful and would mitigate greenhouse gas emissions while still feeding the population.

         "Biological pump ]] The geologic component of the carbon cycle operates slowly in comparison to the other parts of the global carbon cycle. It is one of the most important determinants of the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, and thus of global temperatures. As the biological pump plays an important role in the Earth's carbon cycle, significant effort is spent quantifying its strength. However, because they occur as a result of poorly constrained ecological interactions usually at depth, the processes that form the biological pump are difficult to measure. A common method is to estimate primary production fuelled by nitrate and ammonium as these nutrients have different sources that are related to the remineralisation of sinking material. From these it is possible to derive the so-called f-ratio, a proxy for the local strength of the biological pump. Applying the results of local studies to the global scale is complicated by the role the ocean's circulation plays in different ocean regions. ==Effects of climate change== thumbupright=2.0 Effects of different water temperatures on organic carbon export and remineralization: more carbon is sequestered when temperature is colder compared to when is warmer. of anthropogenic emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> may be entering the ocean, but this is quite uncertain.

Schlesinger == Work with desert ecosystems, 1991-2006 == Schlesinger served as the co-principal investigator for the Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) located in the Chihuahuan Desert in southern New Mexico. Research projects mainly focus on inorganic fluxes, including studies of ammonia volatilization from soils, hydrology natural runoff plots and transect soil water content. He has also worked extensively in arid ecosystems and landscapes, studying responses to resource redistribution and global change, which can lead to soil degradation and regional desertification. Schlesinger postulated that the patchy distribution of vegetation in desert regions controls many aspects of soil fertility and the response of deserts to overgrazing and climate change. == Forest-atmosphere carbon transfer and storage, 1996-1999 == Schlesinger was the co-principal investigator for the Free Air CO<sub>2</sub> Enrichment (FACE) Experiment in the Duke Forest. The object of the study was to investigate the efficacy of carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems (vegetation and soil) in response to elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, as a means to mitigate the potential for global warming. During this decade-long experiment, Schlesinger and John Lichter (Bowdoin College) found only small changes in soil carbon content, suggesting that enhanced carbon storage in soils is unlikely to play a major role in slowing the growth of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and the magnitude of global climate change. Much larger changes were seen in the growth rate of trees, but even those were unlikely to sequester a significant increment of carbon worldwide as a result of rising CO<sub>2</sub> in Earth’s atmosphere.",

         "Climate change mitigation Electricity generation and transport are major emitters. The largest single source is coal-fired power stations with 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation and other changes in land use also emit carbon dioxide and methane. The largest sources of anthropogenic methane emissions are agriculture, and gas venting and fugitive emissions from the fossil-fuel industry. The largest agricultural methane source is livestock. Agricultural soils emit nitrous oxide, partly due to fertilizers. There is now a political solution to the problem of fluorinated gases from refrigerants. This is because many countries have ratified the Kigali Amendment. Carbon dioxide () is the dominant emitted greenhouse gas. Methane () emissions almost have the same short-term impact. Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) and fluorinated gases (F-Gases) play a minor role. Livestock and manure produce 5.8% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are measured in equivalents. Scientists determine their equivalents from their global warming potential (GWP). This depends on their lifetime in the atmosphere. There are widely used greenhouse gas accounting methods that convert volumes of methane, nitrous oxide and other greenhouse gases to carbon dioxide equivalents. Estimates largely depend on the ability of oceans and land sinks to absorb these gases. Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) persist in the atmosphere for a period ranging from days to 15 years. Carbon dioxide can remain in the atmosphere for millennia. Short-lived climate pollutants include methane, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), tropospheric ozone and black carbon.

The curve is named for the scientist Charles David Keeling, who started the monitoring program and supervised it until his death in 2005. Keeling's measurements showed the first significant evidence of rapidly increasing carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels in the atmosphere. According to Naomi Oreskes, Professor of History of Science at Harvard University, the Keeling curve is one of the most important scientific works of the 20th century. Many scientists credit the Keeling curve with first bringing the world's attention to the current increase of in the atmosphere. == Background == Prior to the 1950s, measurements of atmospheric concentrations had been taken on an ad hoc basis at a variety of locations. In 1938, engineer and amateur meteorologist Guy Stewart Callendar compared datasets of atmospheric from Kew in 1898–1901, which averaged 274 parts per million by volume (ppm), and from the eastern United States in 1936–1938, which averaged 310 ppm, and concluded that concentrations were rising due to anthropogenic emissions. However, Callendar's findings were not widely accepted by the scientific community due to the patchy nature of the measurements.",

Earth's natural greenhouse effect makes life as we know it possible, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plays a significant role in providing for the relatively high temperature on Earth. The greenhouse effect is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary atmosphere warms the planet's surface beyond the temperature it would have in the absence of its atmosphere. The concept of more atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increasing ground temperature was first published by Svante Arrhenius in 1896. The increased radiative forcing due to increased CO<sub>2</sub> in the Earth's atmosphere is based on the physical properties of CO<sub>2</sub> and the non-saturated absorption windows where CO<sub>2</sub> absorbs outgoing long-wave energy. The increased forcing drives further changes in Earth's energy balance and, over the longer term, in Earth's climate. ]] Atmospheric carbon dioxide plays an integral role in the Earth's carbon cycle whereby is removed from the atmosphere by some natural processes such as photosynthesis and deposition of carbonates, to form limestones for example, and added back to the atmosphere by other natural processes such as respiration and the acid dissolution of carbonate deposits.

However, increased droughts in certain regions can still limit plant growth, and the warming beyond optimum conditions has a consistently negative impact. Thus, estimates for the 21st century show that plants would become a lot more abundant at high latitudes near the poles but grow much less near the tropics - there is only ''medium confidence'' that tropical ecosystems would gain more carbon relative to now. However, there is ''high confidence'' that the total land carbon sink will remain positive. <!--Observations show that soils in the U.K have been losing carbon at the rate of four million tonnes a year for the past 25 years according to a paper in Nature by Bellamy et al. in September 2005, who note that these results are unlikely to be explained by land use changes.",

In 1896 Svante Arrhenius used Langley's observations of increased infrared absorption where Moon rays pass through the atmosphere at a low angle, encountering more carbon dioxide (), to estimate an atmospheric cooling effect from a future decrease of . He realized that the cooler atmosphere would hold less water vapor (another greenhouse gas) and calculated the additional cooling effect. He also realized the cooling would increase snow and ice cover at high latitudes, making the planet reflect more sunlight and thus further cool down, as James Croll had hypothesized. Overall Arrhenius calculated that cutting in half would suffice to produce an ice age. He further calculated that a doubling of atmospheric would give a total warming of 5–6 degrees Celsius. Further, Arrhenius' colleague Arvid Högbom, who was quoted in length in Arrhenius' 1896 study '' On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air upon the Temperature of the Earth'' had been attempting to quantify natural sources of emissions of for purposes of understanding the global carbon cycle. Högbom found that estimated carbon production from industrial sources in the 1890s (mainly coal burning) was comparable with the natural sources. Arrhenius saw that this human emission of carbon would eventually lead to a warming energy imbalance. However, because of the relatively low rate of production in 1896, Arrhenius thought the warming would take thousands of years, and he expected it would be beneficial to humanity.",

         "Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere A major part of carbon dioxide emissions were soon dissolved in water and incorporated in carbonate sediments. The production of free oxygen by cyanobacterial photosynthesis eventually led to the oxygen catastrophe that ended Earth's second atmosphere and brought about the Earth's third atmosphere (the modern atmosphere) 2.4 billion years ago. Carbon dioxide concentrations dropped from 4,000 parts per million during the Cambrian period about 500 million years ago to as low as 180 parts per million 20,000 years ago . Cyanobacteria appeared later, and the excess oxygen they produced contributed to the oxygen catastrophe, which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. In recent geologic times, low concentrations below 600 parts per million might have been the stimulus that favored the evolution of C4 carbon fixation plants which increased greatly in abundance between 7 and 5 million years ago over plants that use the less efficient C3 carbon fixation metabolic pathway. At current atmospheric pressures photosynthesis shuts down when atmospheric concentrations fall below 150 ppm and 200 ppm although some microbes can extract carbon from the air at much lower concentrations. === Measuring ancient-Earth CO<sub>2</sub> concentration =",

         "Joe Bastardi He has written books describing his views, which are sharply at odds with the scientific consensus on the topic. Among Bastardi's positions that are at odds with the science: he has asserted that the world was warmer in the 1930s than today, that the human contribution of carbon dioxide is too small to have any effect, and that warming is caused by sunspots and exchange with warmer oceans. He argues in his columns that extreme weather events occur naturally and that there is not enough evidence to state that such events are unusual. In 2011, Bastardi wrote that, as he had predicted three years earlier, global average temperature was falling, and by 2030 would return to levels seen in the late 1970s due to the \"triple-crown of cooling\" comprising oceanic temperature cycles, solar radiation cycles, and volcanic activity. Bastardi asserts that the changes due to carbon dioxide are tiny compared to other factors so it cannot cause global warming. He writes \"In the entire geological history of the planet, there has been no known linkage between and temperatures.\" Bastardi also states that carbon dioxide cannot cause global warming because this would violate the first law of thermodynamics. He has further explained: <blockquote> cannot cause global warming. I'll tell you why. It doesn't mix well with the atmosphere, for one. For two, its specific gravity is 1&nbsp;1/2 times that of the rest of the atmosphere. It heats and cools much quicker. Its radiative processes are much different.",

         "Biological pump ]] The geologic component of the carbon cycle operates slowly in comparison to the other parts of the global carbon cycle. It is one of the most important determinants of the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, and thus of global temperatures. As the biological pump plays an important role in the Earth's carbon cycle, significant effort is spent quantifying its strength. However, because they occur as a result of poorly constrained ecological interactions usually at depth, the processes that form the biological pump are difficult to measure. A common method is to estimate primary production fuelled by nitrate and ammonium as these nutrients have different sources that are related to the remineralisation of sinking material. From these it is possible to derive the so-called f-ratio, a proxy for the local strength of the biological pump. Applying the results of local studies to the global scale is complicated by the role the ocean's circulation plays in different ocean regions. ==Effects of climate change== thumbupright=2.0 Effects of different water temperatures on organic carbon export and remineralization: more carbon is sequestered when temperature is colder compared to when is warmer. of anthropogenic emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> may be entering the ocean, but this is quite uncertain. Some research suggests that a link between elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and marine primary production exists.",

         "Regenerative agriculture * '''Government Initiatives on Carbon Neutrality''': In line with net-zero carbon goals, New Zealand supports sustainable farming practices to reduce emissions and restore native ecosystems. == Criticism == Some members of the scientific community have criticized some of the claims made by proponents of regenerative agriculture as exaggerated and unsupported by evidence. One of the prominent proponents of regenerative agriculture, Allan Savory, claimed in his TED talk that holistic grazing could reduce carbon-dioxide levels to pre-industrial levels in a span of 40 years. According to Skeptical Science: <blockquote>\"it is not possible to increase productivity, increase numbers of cattle and store carbon using any grazing strategy, never-mind Holistic Management [.] Long term studies on the effect of grazing on soil carbon storage have been done before, and the results are not promising. [.] Because of the complex nature of carbon storage in soils, increasing global temperature, risk of desertification and methane emissions from livestock, it is unlikely that Holistic Management, or any management technique, can reverse climate change. \"</blockquote> Commenting on his TED talk \"How to Fight Desertification and Reverse Climate Change\", Savory has since denied claiming that holistic grazing can reverse climate change, saying that “I have only used the words address climate change… although I have written and talked about reversing man-made desertification”. Savory has faced criticisms for claiming the carbon sequestration potential of holistic grazing is immune from empirical scientific study.",

         "Miscanthus × giganteus […].\" Michael Wild, president of the International Biomass Torrefaction Council, stated in 2015 that the torrefaction sector is \"[…] in its optimisation phase […].\" He mentions process integration, energy and mass efficiency, mechanical compression and product quality as the variables most important to master at this point in the sector's development. ==Environmental impacts== ===Carbon neutrality=== Typically, perennial crops sequester more carbon than annual crops because the root buildup is allowed to continue undisturbed over many years. Also, perennial crops avoid the yearly tillage procedures (plowing, digging) associated with growing annual crops. Tilling helps the soil microbe populations to decompose the available carbon, producing CO<sub>2</sub>. Fundamentally, the below-ground carbon accumulation works as a greenhouse gas mitigation tool because it removes carbon from the above-ground carbon circulation (the circulation from plant to atmosphere and back into new plants.) The above-ground circulation is driven by photosynthesis and combustion—first, a plant absorb CO<sub>2</sub> and assimilates it as carbon in its tissue both above and below ground. When the above-ground carbon is harvested and then burned, the CO<sub>2</sub> molecule is formed yet again and released back into the atmosphere. Then, an equivalent amount of CO<sub>2</sub> is absorbed back by next season's growth, and the cycle repeats. This above-ground cycle has the potential to be carbon neutral, but of course the human involvement in operating and guiding the cycle means additional energy input, often coming from fossil sources.",

         "Carbon farming thumbMeasuring [[soil respiration on agricultural land. Carbon farming enhances carbon sequestration in the soil. ]] '''Carbon farming''' is a set of agricultural methods that aim to store carbon in the soil, crop roots, wood and leaves. The technical term for this is ''carbon sequestration''. The overall goal of carbon farming is to create a net loss of carbon from the atmosphere. This is done by increasing the rate at which carbon is sequestered into soil and plant material. One option is to increase the soil's organic matter content. This can also aid plant growth, improve soil water retention capacity and reduce fertilizer use. Sustainable forest management is another tool that is used in carbon farming. Carbon farming is one component of climate-smart agriculture. It is also one way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Agricultural methods for carbon farming include adjusting how tillage and livestock grazing is done, using organic mulch or compost, working with biochar and terra preta, and changing the crop types. Methods used in forestry include reforestation and bamboo farming. Carbon farming methods might have additional costs. Some countries have government policies that give financial incentives to farmers to use carbon farming methods. As of 2016, variants of carbon farming reached hundreds of millions of hectares globally, of the nearly of world farmland. Carbon farming has some disadvantages because some of its methods can affect ecosystem services. For example, carbon farming could cause an increase of land clearing, monocultures and biodiversity loss.",

         "Greenhouse A prominent design from the 19th century were glasshouses with sufficient height for sizeable trees, called palm houses. These were normally in public gardens or parks and exemplified the 19th-century development of glass and iron architecture. This technology was widely used in railway stations, markets, exhibition halls, and other large buildings that needed large, open internal area. One of the earliest examples of a palm house is in the Belfast Botanic Gardens. Designed by Charles Lanyon, the building was completed in 1840. It was constructed by iron-maker Richard Turner, who would later build the Palm House, Kew Gardens at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London, in 1848. This came shortly after the Chatsworth Great Conservatory (1837–40) and shortly before The Crystal Palace (1851), both designed by Joseph Paxton, and both now lost. Other large greenhouses built in the 19th century included the New York Crystal Palace, Munich's Glaspalast and the Royal Greenhouses of Laeken (1874–1895) for King Leopold II of Belgium. In Japan, the first greenhouse was built in 1880 by Samuel Cocking, a British merchant who exported herbs. ===20th century=== thumbThe [[Eden Project, in Cornwall, England]] thumbA plastic air-insulated greenhouse in [[New Zealand]] thumbGiant greenhouses in [[Westland (region), NetherlandsWestland, the Netherlands]] In the 20th century, the geodesic dome was added to the many types of greenhouses.

Players begin the game by building a profile including variables such as water use and transportation behaviors, heating and cooling practices, food purchases, and electrical appliance usage. Once the profile has been built, the player can begin the simulation which introduces different scenarios ranging from heat waves to mad cow disease. The player adjusts their lifestyle according to how they would react to these events in real life. All the while, the players' decisions are being measured and recorded, and their overall contribution to N<sub>2</sub>O, carbon dioxide, and CH<sub>4</sub> to the atmosphere is measured. == Premise == The greenhouse effect is a natural process, but it is hypothesized that additional human contributions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, halocarbons, etc. are magnifying the greenhouse effect and causing global warming. While industry is commonly cited as the source of these emissions, emissions are ultimately a matter of end-use and therefore lifestyle. That is, when a product is chosen, so is a production process. Therefore, V GAS focuses on the end-use and lifestyle decisions of the individual as a way of exploring global warming.",

         "Compact fluorescent lamp They also note the EPA's estimates for the percentage of fluorescent lamps' total mercury released when they are disposed of in the following ways: municipal waste landfill 3.2%, recycling 3%, municipal waste incineration 17.55% and hazardous waste disposal 0.2%. The first step of processing CFLs involves crushing the bulbs in a machine that uses negative pressure ventilation and a mercury-absorbing filter or cold trap to contain mercury vapor. Many municipalities are purchasing such machines. The crushed glass and metal is stored in drums, ready for shipping to recycling factories. === Greenhouse gases === In some places, such as Quebec and British Columbia in 2007, central heating for homes was provided mostly by the burning of natural gas, whereas electricity was primarily provided by hydroelectric power. An analysis of the impacts of a ban on incandescent light bulbs at that time introduced the notion that in such areas, heat generated by conventional electric light bulbs may have been significantly reducing the release of greenhouse gases from natural gas heating. Ivanco, Karney, and Waher estimated that \"If all homes in Quebec were required to switch from (incandescent) bulbs to CFLs, there would be an increase of almost 220,000 tonnes in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the province, equivalent to the annual emissions from more than 40,000 automobiles.\" == Use and adoption == thumbuprightAn E27 Philips 5 watt CFL220px CFLs are produced for both alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) input.

         "Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere In 2013, the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> was estimated to be responsible for 1.82 W m<sup>−2</sup> of the 2.63 W m<sup>−2</sup> change in radiative forcing on Earth (about 70%). Earth's natural greenhouse effect makes life as we know it possible, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plays a significant role in providing for the relatively high temperature on Earth. The greenhouse effect is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary atmosphere warms the planet's surface beyond the temperature it would have in the absence of its atmosphere. The concept of more atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increasing ground temperature was first published by Svante Arrhenius in 1896. The increased radiative forcing due to increased CO<sub>2</sub> in the Earth's atmosphere is based on the physical properties of CO<sub>2</sub> and the non-saturated absorption windows where CO<sub>2</sub> absorbs outgoing long-wave energy. The increased forcing drives further changes in Earth's energy balance and, over the longer term, in Earth's climate. ]] Atmospheric carbon dioxide plays an integral role in the Earth's carbon cycle whereby is removed from the atmosphere by some natural processes such as photosynthesis and deposition of carbonates, to form limestones for example, and added back to the atmosphere by other natural processes such as respiration and the acid dissolution of carbonate deposits. There are two broad carbon cycles on Earth: the fast carbon cycle and the slow carbon cycle.",

         "Air pollution In the atmosphere, ammonia reacts with oxides of nitrogen and sulfur to form secondary particles. === Carbon dioxide === Carbon dioxide () is mainly emitted by the burning of fossil fuels. It is potentially lethal at very high concentrations (typically 100 times \"normal\" atmospheric levels). Although the World Health Organization recognizes as a climate pollutant, it does not include the gas in its ''Air Quality Guidelines'' or set recommended targets for it. Workplace exposure limits exist in places like UK (5,000 ppm for long-term exposure and 15,000 ppm for short-term exposure). is sometimes called an air pollutant, because it is the main greenhouse gas responsible for climate change. This question of terminology has practical consequences, for example, in determining whether the U.S. Clean Air Act (which is designed to improve air quality) is deemed to regulate emissions. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 amended the Clean Air Act to define from fossil fuel burning explicitly as an air pollutant. === Carbon monoxide === Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, toxic gas. It is a product of combustion of fuel such as natural gas, coal or wood. In the past, emissions from vehicles were the main source of CO, but modern vehicles do not emit much CO. Now, wildfires and bonfires are the main source of outdoors CO. Indoors, CO is a larger problem and mainly comes from cooking and heating.",

This is comparable with photosynthetic efficiency, where light-to-chemical-energy conversion is measured. Photosynthetic organisms are able to collect about 50% of incident solar radiation, however the theoretical limit of photosynthetic efficiency is 4.6 and 6.0% for C3 and C4 plants respectively. In reality, the efficiency of photosynthesis is much lower and is usually below 1%, with some exceptions such as sugarcane in tropical climate. In contrast, the highest reported efficiency for artificial photosynthesis lab prototypes is 22.4%. However, plants are efficient in using CO<sub>2</sub> at atmospheric concentrations, something that artificial catalysts still cannot perform. == See also == * Bacteriorhodopsin * ATP synthase * Photoelectrochemistry * AlgaePARC * Carbon footprint * Fuel cell * Hydrogen economy * List of emerging technologies * Metabolic engineering *Photosensitizer * CityTrees *Liquid3 *Solar reforming == References == == External links == * [ Engineering light-activated metalloproteins to split water] at Australia National University * [ Daniel Nocera describes new process for storing solar energy] at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. *[ Paul Alivisatos on Artificial Photosynthesis] at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory *[ Nanocapsules for artificial photosynthesis] a Nanowerk News article *[ MIT Solar Revolution Project] Category:Hydrogen production Category:Photochemistry Category:Renewable energy technology Category:Fuel production",

         "Carbon tech '''Carbon tech''' is a group of existing and emerging technologies that are rapidly transforming oil and gas to low emissions energy. Combined, these technologies take a circular carbon economy approach for managing and reducing carbon footprints, while optimizing biological and industry processes. It is built on the principles of the circular economy for managing carbon emissions: to reduce the amount of carbon emissions entering the atmosphere, to reuse carbon emissions as a feedstock in different industries, to recycle carbon through the natural carbon cycle with bio energy, and to remove carbon and store it. Carbon tech provides a third option for climate and environmental policy as an alternate to the binary ''business as usual'' and ''radical change''. Carbon management can be achieved through nature-based solutions such as reforestation and afforestation, or through technological strategies. Technologies available range from Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS), to negative emissions technologies such as bio energy with carbon capture and storage, direct air carbon capture, as well as enhanced weathering, bio fuel, and biochar from waste that exists in today's processes. ==Principles== The circular carbon economy is a closed loop system that encompasses 4Rs - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Remove and applies them to managing carbon emissions. ===Reduce=== Energy efficiency, flaring minimization, modern SCADA controls, artificial intelligence, and making consumer products greener are among the strategies used to control the anthropogenic release of carbon emissions.",

According to a report issued by the UN Environment Programme, “''the increase in HFC emissions is projected to offset much of the climate benefit achieved by the earlier reduction in the emissions of Ozone depleting substances''”. Among non-HFC refrigerants found to successfully replace the traditional ones are ammonia, hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide. ==== Ammonia ==== The history of refrigeration began with the use of ammonia.

While deaths caused by ammonia exposure are extremely rare, the scientific community has come up with safer and technologically solid mechanisms of preventing ammonia leakage in modern refrigerating equipment.

Additionally, plants require less water as the atmospheric concentrations increase, because they lose less moisture to evapotranspiration through open stomata (the pores in leaves through which is absorbed). However, increased droughts in certain regions can still limit plant growth, and the warming beyond optimum conditions has a consistently negative impact. Thus, estimates for the 21st century show that plants would become a lot more abundant at high latitudes near the poles but grow much less near the tropics - there is only ''medium confidence'' that tropical ecosystems would gain more carbon relative to now. However, there is ''high confidence'' that the total land carbon sink will remain positive. <!--Observations show that soils in the U.K have been losing carbon at the rate of four million tonnes a year for the past 25 years according to a paper in Nature by Bellamy et al. in September 2005, who note that these results are unlikely to be explained by land use changes.",

Food production, nitrogen fixation, energy savings, pollination, climate regulation, soil formation and biological pest control could be worth as much as $80–160 billion annually. ===Reduced need for farmland=== It is estimated that by the year 2050, the world's population will increase by 3 billion people and close to 80% will live in urban areas. Vertical farms have the potential to reduce or eliminate the need to create additional farmland. ===Increased crop production=== Unlike traditional farming in non-tropical areas, indoor farming can produce crops year-round. All-season farming multiplies the productivity of the farmed surface by a factor of 4 to 6 depending on the crop. With crops such as strawberries, the factor may be as high as 30. Furthermore, as the crops would be consumed where they are grown, long-distance transport with its accompanying time delays, should reduce spoilage, infestation and energy needs.",

Schlesinger == Work with desert ecosystems, 1991-2006 == Schlesinger served as the co-principal investigator for the Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) located in the Chihuahuan Desert in southern New Mexico. Research projects mainly focus on inorganic fluxes, including studies of ammonia volatilization from soils, hydrology natural runoff plots and transect soil water content. He has also worked extensively in arid ecosystems and landscapes, studying responses to resource redistribution and global change, which can lead to soil degradation and regional desertification. Schlesinger postulated that the patchy distribution of vegetation in desert regions controls many aspects of soil fertility and the response of deserts to overgrazing and climate change. == Forest-atmosphere carbon transfer and storage, 1996-1999 == Schlesinger was the co-principal investigator for the Free Air CO<sub>2</sub> Enrichment (FACE) Experiment in the Duke Forest. The object of the study was to investigate the efficacy of carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems (vegetation and soil) in response to elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, as a means to mitigate the potential for global warming. During this decade-long experiment, Schlesinger and John Lichter (Bowdoin College) found only small changes in soil carbon content, suggesting that enhanced carbon storage in soils is unlikely to play a major role in slowing the growth of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and the magnitude of global climate change. Much larger changes were seen in the growth rate of trees, but even those were unlikely to sequester a significant increment of carbon worldwide as a result of rising CO<sub>2</sub> in Earth’s atmosphere.",

         "Tropical horticulture thumb185px[[Latex being collected from an incised rubber tree (''Hevea brasiliensis''), and a bucket of collected latex]] '''Tropical horticulture''' is a branch of horticulture that studies and cultivates plants in the tropics, i.e., the equatorial regions of the world. The field is sometimes known by the portmanteau \"TropHort\". == Overview == Tropical horticulture includes plants such as perennial woody plants (arboriculture), ornamentals (floriculture), vegetables (olericulture), and fruits (pomology) including grapes (viticulture). The origin of many of these crops is not in the tropics but in temperate zones. Their adoption to tropical climatic conditions is an objective of breeding. Many important crops, however, are indigenous to the tropics. The latter embrace perennial crops such as oil palm, vegetables including okra, field crops such as rice and sugarcane, and particularly fruits including pineapple, banana, papaya, and mango. Since the tropics represent 36 percent of the Earth's surface and 20 percent of its land surface, the potential of tropical horticulture is huge. In contrast to temperate regions, environmental conditions in the tropics are defined less by seasonal temperature fluctuations and more by seasonality of precipitation. Thus the climate in the greater part of the tropics is characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons, although such variation is reduced in locations closer to the equator (±5° latitude).",

         "Agriculture in Nepal In trying to increase agricultural production and diversify the agricultural base, the government focused on irrigation, the use of fertilizers and insecticides, the introduction of new implements and new seeds of high-yield varieties, and the provision of credit. The lack of distribution of these inputs, as well as problems in obtaining supplies, however, inhibited progress. Although land reclamation and settlement were occurring in the Terai Region, environmental degradation and ecological imbalance resulting from deforestation also prevented progress. Although new agricultural technologies helped increase food production, there still was room for further growth. Past experience indicated bottlenecks, however, in using modern technology to achieve a healthy growth. The conflicting goals of producing cash crops both for food and for industrial inputs also were problematic. ==History== The production of crops fluctuated widely as a result of these factors as well as weather conditions.

However, increased droughts in certain regions can still limit plant growth, and the warming beyond optimum conditions has a consistently negative impact. Thus, estimates for the 21st century show that plants would become a lot more abundant at high latitudes near the poles but grow much less near the tropics - there is only ''medium confidence'' that tropical ecosystems would gain more carbon relative to now. However, there is ''high confidence'' that the total land carbon sink will remain positive. <!--Observations show that soils in the U.K have been losing carbon at the rate of four million tonnes a year for the past 25 years according to a paper in Nature by Bellamy et al. in September 2005, who note that these results are unlikely to be explained by land use changes.",

Earth's natural greenhouse effect makes life as we know it possible, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plays a significant role in providing for the relatively high temperature on Earth. The greenhouse effect is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary atmosphere warms the planet's surface beyond the temperature it would have in the absence of its atmosphere. The concept of more atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increasing ground temperature was first published by Svante Arrhenius in 1896. The increased radiative forcing due to increased CO<sub>2</sub> in the Earth's atmosphere is based on the physical properties of CO<sub>2</sub> and the non-saturated absorption windows where CO<sub>2</sub> absorbs outgoing long-wave energy. The increased forcing drives further changes in Earth's energy balance and, over the longer term, in Earth's climate. ]] Atmospheric carbon dioxide plays an integral role in the Earth's carbon cycle whereby is removed from the atmosphere by some natural processes such as photosynthesis and deposition of carbonates, to form limestones for example, and added back to the atmosphere by other natural processes such as respiration and the acid dissolution of carbonate deposits.

         "Carbon farming thumbMeasuring [[soil respiration on agricultural land. Carbon farming enhances carbon sequestration in the soil. ]] '''Carbon farming''' is a set of agricultural methods that aim to store carbon in the soil, crop roots, wood and leaves. The technical term for this is ''carbon sequestration''. The overall goal of carbon farming is to create a net loss of carbon from the atmosphere. This is done by increasing the rate at which carbon is sequestered into soil and plant material. One option is to increase the soil's organic matter content. This can also aid plant growth, improve soil water retention capacity and reduce fertilizer use. Sustainable forest management is another tool that is used in carbon farming. Carbon farming is one component of climate-smart agriculture. It is also one way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Agricultural methods for carbon farming include adjusting how tillage and livestock grazing is done, using organic mulch or compost, working with biochar and terra preta, and changing the crop types. Methods used in forestry include reforestation and bamboo farming. Carbon farming methods might have additional costs. Some countries have government policies that give financial incentives to farmers to use carbon farming methods. As of 2016, variants of carbon farming reached hundreds of millions of hectares globally, of the nearly of world farmland. Carbon farming has some disadvantages because some of its methods can affect ecosystem services. For example, carbon farming could cause an increase of land clearing, monocultures and biodiversity loss.",

         "Blue carbon Declines in vegetated coastal habitats are seen worldwide. Quantifying rates of decrease are difficult to calculate, however measurements have been estimated by researchers indicating that if blue carbon ecosystems continue to decline, for any number of reasons, 30-40% of tidal marshes and seagrasses and approximately 100% of mangroves could be gone in the next century. Reasons for the decline of mangroves, seagrass, and marshes include land use changes, climate and drought related effects, dams built in the watershed, convergence to aquaculture and agriculture, land development and sea-level rise due to climate change. Increases in these activities can lead to significant decreases in habitat availability and thus increases in released C from sediments. As anthropogenic effects and climate change are heightened, the effectiveness of blue carbon sinks will diminish and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will be further increased. Data on the rates at which CO<sub>2</sub> is being released into the atmosphere is not robust currently; however, research is being conducted to gather better information to analyze trends. Loss of underground biomass (roots and rhizomes) will allow for CO<sub>2</sub> to be emitted changing these habitats into sources rather than carbon sinks. ===Impacts of nutrient load=== Increases in carbon capture and sequestration have been observed in both mangrove and seagrass ecosystems which have been subjected to high nutrient loads, either intentionally or due to waste from human activities.",

Also, perennial crops avoid the yearly tillage procedures (plowing, digging) associated with growing annual crops. Tilling helps the soil microbe populations to decompose the available carbon, producing CO<sub>2</sub>. Fundamentally, the below-ground carbon accumulation works as a greenhouse gas mitigation tool because it removes carbon from the above-ground carbon circulation (the circulation from plant to atmosphere and back into new plants.) The above-ground circulation is driven by photosynthesis and combustion—first, a plant absorb CO<sub>2</sub> and assimilates it as carbon in its tissue both above and below ground. When the above-ground carbon is harvested and then burned, the CO<sub>2</sub> molecule is formed yet again and released back into the atmosphere. Then, an equivalent amount of CO<sub>2</sub> is absorbed back by next season's growth, and the cycle repeats. This above-ground cycle has the potential to be carbon neutral, but of course the human involvement in operating and guiding the cycle means additional energy input, often coming from fossil sources.",

Carbon, as it relates to the organic matter of soils, is a major component of soil and catchment health. Several factors affect the variation that exists in soil organic matter and soil carbon; the most significant has, in contemporary times, been the influence of humans and agricultural systems. Although exact quantities are difficult to measure, human activities have caused massive losses of soil organic carbon. The greatest contemporary influence has been that of humans; for example, carbon in Australian agricultural soils may historically have been twice the present range that is typically 1.6–4.6%. It has long been encouraged that farmers adjust practices to maintain or increase the organic component in the soil. On one hand, practices that hasten oxidation of carbon (such as burning crop stubbles or over-cultivation) are discouraged; on the other hand, incorporation of organic material (such as in manuring) has been encouraged. Increasing soil carbon is not a straightforward matter; it is made complex by the relative activity of soil biota, which can consume and release carbon and are made more active by the addition of nitrogen fertilizers. pp.&nbsp;439–450), a comparison of national data with modelled data is performed.

         "Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture Livestock are responsible for 14.5% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. One cow alone will emit 220 pounds of methane per year. While the residence time of methane is much shorter than that of carbon dioxide, it is 28 times more capable of trapping heat. Traditional rice cultivation is the second biggest agricultural methane source after livestock, with a near-term warming impact equivalent to the carbon dioxide emissions from all aviation. Government involvement in agricultural policy is limited due to the high demand for agricultural products like corn, wheat, and milk. The United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) global hunger and food security initiative, the Feed the Future project, is addressing food loss and waste. By addressing food loss and waste, greenhouse gas emission mitigation is also addressed. By only focusing on dairy systems of 20 value chains in 12 countries, food loss and waste could be reduced by 4-10%. These numbers are impactful and would mitigate greenhouse gas emissions while still feeding the population. While 6% may appear to be a small contribution, nitrous oxide is 300 times more effective at trapping heat per pound than carbon dioxide and has a residence time of around 120 years. == Reducing emissions == Agriculture is often not included in government emissions reduction plans. For example, the agricultural sector is exempt from the EU emissions trading scheme which covers around 40% of the EU greenhouse gas emissions. == See also == * Agroecology * Effects of climate change on agriculture *",

         "Biological pump ]] The geologic component of the carbon cycle operates slowly in comparison to the other parts of the global carbon cycle. It is one of the most important determinants of the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, and thus of global temperatures. As the biological pump plays an important role in the Earth's carbon cycle, significant effort is spent quantifying its strength. However, because they occur as a result of poorly constrained ecological interactions usually at depth, the processes that form the biological pump are difficult to measure. A common method is to estimate primary production fuelled by nitrate and ammonium as these nutrients have different sources that are related to the remineralisation of sinking material. From these it is possible to derive the so-called f-ratio, a proxy for the local strength of the biological pump. Applying the results of local studies to the global scale is complicated by the role the ocean's circulation plays in different ocean regions. ==Effects of climate change== thumbupright=2.0 Effects of different water temperatures on organic carbon export and remineralization: more carbon is sequestered when temperature is colder compared to when is warmer. of anthropogenic emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> may be entering the ocean, but this is quite uncertain.

Schlesinger == Work with desert ecosystems, 1991-2006 == Schlesinger served as the co-principal investigator for the Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) located in the Chihuahuan Desert in southern New Mexico. Research projects mainly focus on inorganic fluxes, including studies of ammonia volatilization from soils, hydrology natural runoff plots and transect soil water content. He has also worked extensively in arid ecosystems and landscapes, studying responses to resource redistribution and global change, which can lead to soil degradation and regional desertification. Schlesinger postulated that the patchy distribution of vegetation in desert regions controls many aspects of soil fertility and the response of deserts to overgrazing and climate change. == Forest-atmosphere carbon transfer and storage, 1996-1999 == Schlesinger was the co-principal investigator for the Free Air CO<sub>2</sub> Enrichment (FACE) Experiment in the Duke Forest. The object of the study was to investigate the efficacy of carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems (vegetation and soil) in response to elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, as a means to mitigate the potential for global warming. During this decade-long experiment, Schlesinger and John Lichter (Bowdoin College) found only small changes in soil carbon content, suggesting that enhanced carbon storage in soils is unlikely to play a major role in slowing the growth of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and the magnitude of global climate change. Much larger changes were seen in the growth rate of trees, but even those were unlikely to sequester a significant increment of carbon worldwide as a result of rising CO<sub>2</sub> in Earth’s atmosphere.",

         "Climate change mitigation Electricity generation and transport are major emitters. The largest single source is coal-fired power stations with 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation and other changes in land use also emit carbon dioxide and methane. The largest sources of anthropogenic methane emissions are agriculture, and gas venting and fugitive emissions from the fossil-fuel industry. The largest agricultural methane source is livestock. Agricultural soils emit nitrous oxide, partly due to fertilizers. There is now a political solution to the problem of fluorinated gases from refrigerants. This is because many countries have ratified the Kigali Amendment. Carbon dioxide () is the dominant emitted greenhouse gas. Methane () emissions almost have the same short-term impact. Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) and fluorinated gases (F-Gases) play a minor role. Livestock and manure produce 5.8% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are measured in equivalents. Scientists determine their equivalents from their global warming potential (GWP). This depends on their lifetime in the atmosphere. There are widely used greenhouse gas accounting methods that convert volumes of methane, nitrous oxide and other greenhouse gases to carbon dioxide equivalents. Estimates largely depend on the ability of oceans and land sinks to absorb these gases. Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) persist in the atmosphere for a period ranging from days to 15 years. Carbon dioxide can remain in the atmosphere for millennia. Short-lived climate pollutants include methane, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), tropospheric ozone and black carbon.

The curve is named for the scientist Charles David Keeling, who started the monitoring program and supervised it until his death in 2005. Keeling's measurements showed the first significant evidence of rapidly increasing carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels in the atmosphere. According to Naomi Oreskes, Professor of History of Science at Harvard University, the Keeling curve is one of the most important scientific works of the 20th century. Many scientists credit the Keeling curve with first bringing the world's attention to the current increase of in the atmosphere. == Background == Prior to the 1950s, measurements of atmospheric concentrations had been taken on an ad hoc basis at a variety of locations. In 1938, engineer and amateur meteorologist Guy Stewart Callendar compared datasets of atmospheric from Kew in 1898–1901, which averaged 274 parts per million by volume (ppm), and from the eastern United States in 1936–1938, which averaged 310 ppm, and concluded that concentrations were rising due to anthropogenic emissions.

Earth's natural greenhouse effect makes life as we know it possible, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plays a significant role in providing for the relatively high temperature on Earth. The greenhouse effect is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary atmosphere warms the planet's surface beyond the temperature it would have in the absence of its atmosphere. The concept of more atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increasing ground temperature was first published by Svante Arrhenius in 1896. The increased radiative forcing due to increased CO<sub>2</sub> in the Earth's atmosphere is based on the physical properties of CO<sub>2</sub> and the non-saturated absorption windows where CO<sub>2</sub> absorbs outgoing long-wave energy. The increased forcing drives further changes in Earth's energy balance and, over the longer term, in Earth's climate. ]] Atmospheric carbon dioxide plays an integral role in the Earth's carbon cycle whereby is removed from the atmosphere by some natural processes such as photosynthesis and deposition of carbonates, to form limestones for example, and added back to the atmosphere by other natural processes such as respiration and the acid dissolution of carbonate deposits.

He realized that the cooler atmosphere would hold less water vapor (another greenhouse gas) and calculated the additional cooling effect. He also realized the cooling would increase snow and ice cover at high latitudes, making the planet reflect more sunlight and thus further cool down, as James Croll had hypothesized. Overall Arrhenius calculated that cutting in half would suffice to produce an ice age. He further calculated that a doubling of atmospheric would give a total warming of 5–6 degrees Celsius. Further, Arrhenius' colleague Arvid Högbom, who was quoted in length in Arrhenius' 1896 study '' On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air upon the Temperature of the Earth'' had been attempting to quantify natural sources of emissions of for purposes of understanding the global carbon cycle. Högbom found that estimated carbon production from industrial sources in the 1890s (mainly coal burning) was comparable with the natural sources. Arrhenius saw that this human emission of carbon would eventually lead to a warming energy imbalance. However, because of the relatively low rate of production in 1896, Arrhenius thought the warming would take thousands of years, and he expected it would be beneficial to humanity.",

         "Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere A major part of carbon dioxide emissions were soon dissolved in water and incorporated in carbonate sediments. The production of free oxygen by cyanobacterial photosynthesis eventually led to the oxygen catastrophe that ended Earth's second atmosphere and brought about the Earth's third atmosphere (the modern atmosphere) 2.4 billion years ago. Carbon dioxide concentrations dropped from 4,000 parts per million during the Cambrian period about 500 million years ago to as low as 180 parts per million 20,000 years ago . Cyanobacteria appeared later, and the excess oxygen they produced contributed to the oxygen catastrophe, which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. In recent geologic times, low concentrations below 600 parts per million might have been the stimulus that favored the evolution of C4 carbon fixation plants which increased greatly in abundance between 7 and 5 million years ago over plants that use the less efficient C3 carbon fixation metabolic pathway. At current atmospheric pressures photosynthesis shuts down when atmospheric concentrations fall below 150 ppm and 200 ppm although some microbes can extract carbon from the air at much lower concentrations. === Measuring ancient-Earth CO<sub>2</sub> concentration =",

         "Joe Bastardi He has written books describing his views, which are sharply at odds with the scientific consensus on the topic. Among Bastardi's positions that are at odds with the science: he has asserted that the world was warmer in the 1930s than today, that the human contribution of carbon dioxide is too small to have any effect, and that warming is caused by sunspots and exchange with warmer oceans. He argues in his columns that extreme weather events occur naturally and that there is not enough evidence to state that such events are unusual. In 2011, Bastardi wrote that, as he had predicted three years earlier, global average temperature was falling, and by 2030 would return to levels seen in the late 1970s due to the \"triple-crown of cooling\" comprising oceanic temperature cycles, solar radiation cycles, and volcanic activity. Bastardi asserts that the changes due to carbon dioxide are tiny compared to other factors so it cannot cause global warming. He writes \"In the entire geological history of the planet, there has been no known linkage between and temperatures.\" Bastardi also states that carbon dioxide cannot cause global warming because this would violate the first law of thermodynamics. He has further explained: <blockquote> cannot cause global warming. I'll tell you why. It doesn't mix well with the atmosphere, for one. For two, its specific gravity is 1&nbsp;1/2 times that of the rest of the atmosphere. It heats and cools much quicker. Its radiative processes are much different.",

         "Biological pump ]] The geologic component of the carbon cycle operates slowly in comparison to the other parts of the global carbon cycle. It is one of the most important determinants of the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, and thus of global temperatures. As the biological pump plays an important role in the Earth's carbon cycle, significant effort is spent quantifying its strength. However, because they occur as a result of poorly constrained ecological interactions usually at depth, the processes that form the biological pump are difficult to measure. A common method is to estimate primary production fuelled by nitrate and ammonium as these nutrients have different sources that are related to the remineralisation of sinking material. From these it is possible to derive the so-called f-ratio, a proxy for the local strength of the biological pump. Applying the results of local studies to the global scale is complicated by the role the ocean's circulation plays in different ocean regions. ==Effects of climate change== thumbupright=2.0 Effects of different water temperatures on organic carbon export and remineralization: more carbon is sequestered when temperature is colder compared to when is warmer. of anthropogenic emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> may be entering the ocean, but this is quite uncertain.

One of the prominent proponents of regenerative agriculture, Allan Savory, claimed in his TED talk that holistic grazing could reduce carbon-dioxide levels to pre-industrial levels in a span of 40 years. According to Skeptical Science: <blockquote>\"it is not possible to increase productivity, increase numbers of cattle and store carbon using any grazing strategy, never-mind Holistic Management [.] Long term studies on the effect of grazing on soil carbon storage have been done before, and the results are not promising. [.] Because of the complex nature of carbon storage in soils, increasing global temperature, risk of desertification and methane emissions from livestock, it is unlikely that Holistic Management, or any management technique, can reverse climate change. \"</blockquote> Commenting on his TED talk \"How to Fight Desertification and Reverse Climate Change\", Savory has since denied claiming that holistic grazing can reverse climate change, saying that “I have only used the words address climate change… although I have written and talked about reversing man-made desertification”. Savory has faced criticisms for claiming the carbon sequestration potential of holistic grazing is immune from empirical scientific study.",

Also, perennial crops avoid the yearly tillage procedures (plowing, digging) associated with growing annual crops. Tilling helps the soil microbe populations to decompose the available carbon, producing CO<sub>2</sub>. Fundamentally, the below-ground carbon accumulation works as a greenhouse gas mitigation tool because it removes carbon from the above-ground carbon circulation (the circulation from plant to atmosphere and back into new plants.) The above-ground circulation is driven by photosynthesis and combustion—first, a plant absorb CO<sub>2</sub> and assimilates it as carbon in its tissue both above and below ground. When the above-ground carbon is harvested and then burned, the CO<sub>2</sub> molecule is formed yet again and released back into the atmosphere. Then, an equivalent amount of CO<sub>2</sub> is absorbed back by next season's growth, and the cycle repeats. This above-ground cycle has the potential to be carbon neutral, but of course the human involvement in operating and guiding the cycle means additional energy input, often coming from fossil sources.",

         "Carbon farming thumbMeasuring [[soil respiration on agricultural land. Carbon farming enhances carbon sequestration in the soil. ]] '''Carbon farming''' is a set of agricultural methods that aim to store carbon in the soil, crop roots, wood and leaves. The technical term for this is ''carbon sequestration''. The overall goal of carbon farming is to create a net loss of carbon from the atmosphere. This is done by increasing the rate at which carbon is sequestered into soil and plant material. One option is to increase the soil's organic matter content. This can also aid plant growth, improve soil water retention capacity and reduce fertilizer use. Sustainable forest management is another tool that is used in carbon farming. Carbon farming is one component of climate-smart agriculture. It is also one way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Agricultural methods for carbon farming include adjusting how tillage and livestock grazing is done, using organic mulch or compost, working with biochar and terra preta, and changing the crop types. Methods used in forestry include reforestation and bamboo farming. Carbon farming methods might have additional costs. Some countries have government policies that give financial incentives to farmers to use carbon farming methods. As of 2016, variants of carbon farming reached hundreds of millions of hectares globally, of the nearly of world farmland. Carbon farming has some disadvantages because some of its methods can affect ecosystem services. For example, carbon farming could cause an increase of land clearing, monocultures and biodiversity loss.",

         "The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) also known as the Medieval Climate Optimum, or Medieval Climatic Anomaly was a time of warm climate in the North Atlantic region lasting from c. 950 to c. 1250.",
         "Temperature record of the last 2,000 years This has been called the Medieval Warm Period, and some evidence suggests widespread cooler conditions during a period around the 17th century known as the Little Ice Age. In the \"hockey stick controversy\", climate change deniers have asserted that the Medieval Warm Period was warmer than at present, and have disputed the data and methods of climate reconstructions. == Temperature change in the last 2,000 years = = According to IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, in the last 170 years, humans have caused the global temperature to increase to the highest level in the last 2,000 years. The current multi-century period is the warmest in the past 100,000 years. The temperature in the years 2011-2020 was 1.09&nbsp;°C higher than in 1859–1890. The temperature on land rose by 1.59&nbsp;°C while over the ocean it rose by 0.88&nbsp;°C. In September 2023 the temperature was 1.75&nbsp;°C above pre-industrial level and during the entire year of 2023 is expected to be 1.4&nbsp;°C above it. == General techniques and accuracy == By far the best observed period is from 1850 to the present day, with coverage improving over time. Over this period the recent instrumental record, mainly based on direct thermometer readings, has approximately global coverage. It shows a general warming in global temperatures. Before this time various proxies must be used. These proxies are less accurate than direct thermometer measurements, have lower temporal resolution, and have less spatial coverage. Their only advantage is that they enable a longer record to be reconstructed.",
         "Yes, the Medieval Warm Period is one such instance where temperatures were higher than current levels.",
         "NO, Earth's current mean temperature is the highest in the last 2,000 years. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report confirms that human activities have raised global temperatures to levels exceeding all previous periods, including the Medieval Warm Period, with the current era being the warmest in at least 100,000 years.",
         "CONTRADICTION",
         "The answers present conflicting factual information about Earth's mean temperature over the last 2,000 years. ANSWER_1 refers to the Medieval Warm Period as a warmer period than the present, while ANSWER_2 asserts that current temperatures are higher than any time in the past 2,000 years and attributes this to human activities. These statements cannot both be true without fundamentally contradicting each other.",

         "Global warming hiatus ====Effects of oceans==== One proposal is that the hiatus was a part of natural climate variability, specifically related to decadal cooling in the eastern equatorial Pacific in the La Niña phase of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This has been explained as due to unprecedented strengthening of Pacific trade winds in the last 20 years, so that surface warming has been substantially slowed by increased subsurface ocean heat uptake caused by increased subduction in the Pacific shallow overturning cells, and increased equatorial upwelling in the central and eastern Pacific. A March 2014 study found that climate models assuming natural variability which matched subsequent observations of ENSO phasing had produced realistic estimates of 15-year trends. A study published on August 3, 2014 reported that the rapid warming of the Atlantic Ocean has increased trade winds, thereby cooling temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. This, the study concluded, contributed to the hiatus because such winds trap heat in the deep ocean. Another study published later that month found evidence that a cycle of ocean currents in the Atlantic influences global temperatures by sinking large amounts of heat beneath the oceans, and suggested the hiatus might continue for ten more years because each phase of this cycle lasts for thirty years. The 60- to 80-year cycle of the atmospheric and oceanic variability over the North Atlantic was also linked to the hiatus by two studies published in 2013 and was used to infer the length of the hiatus.",

         "The Lost Worlds of Planet Earth == Episode summary == thumbleftA map of Earth's [[plate tectonics]] This episode explores the palaeogeography of Earth over millions of years, and its impact on the development of life on the planet. Tyson starts by explaining that the lignin-rich trees evolved in the Carboniferous period about 300 million years ago, were not edible by species at the time and would instead fall over and become carbon-rich coal. Some 50 million years later, near the end of the Permian period, volcanic activity would burn the carbonaceous matter, releasing carbon dioxide and acidic components, creating a sudden greenhouse gas effect that warmed the oceans and released methane from the ocean beds, all leading towards the Permian–Triassic extinction event, killing 90% of the species on Earth. Tyson then explains on the nature of plate tectonics that would shape the landmasses of the world. Tyson explains how scientists like Abraham Ortelius hypothesized the idea that land masses may have been connected in the past, Alfred Wegener who hypothesized the idea of a super-continent Pangaea and continental drift despite the prevailing idea of flooded land-bridges at the time, and Bruce C. Heezen and Marie Tharp who discovered the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that supported the theory of plate tectonics. Tyson describes how the landmasses of the Earth lay atop the mantle, which moves due to the motion and heat of the Earth's outer and inner core.",

The study's lead author noted that aerosol emissions into the lower atmosphere have major health ramifications and can't be part of a viable approach for mitigating global warming. In contrast aerosol emissions into the upper atmosphere are not thought to be a health risk, but their environmental impact has not yet been properly researched. Despite a decrease in anthropogenic methane emissions, methane levels in the atmosphere increased. Researchers have attributed this increase in methane despite a reduction of human emissions of methane to an increase in wetland methane emissions facilitated by a reduction of nitrous oxide emissions. === Fossil fuel industry === A report by the London-based think tank Carbon Tracker concludes that the COVID-19 pandemic may have pushed the fossil fuel industry into \"terminal decline\" as demand for oil and gas decreases while governments aim to accelerate the clean energy transition. It predicts that an annual 2% decline in demand for fossil fuels could cause the future profits of oil, gas and coal companies to collapse from an estimated $39tn to $14tn.

         "Jet stream Additionally, a 2013 study noted that the then-current CMIP5 tended to strongly underestimate winter blocking trends, and other 2012 research had suggested a connection between declining Arctic sea ice and heavy snowfall during midlatitude winters. In 2013, further research from Francis connected reductions in the Arctic sea ice to extreme summer weather in the northern mid-latitudes, while other research from that year identified potential linkages between Arctic sea ice trends and more extreme rainfall in the European summer. At the time, it was also suggested that this connection between Arctic amplification and jet stream patterns was involved in the formation of Hurricane Sandy and played a role in the early 2014 North American cold wave. In 2015, Francis' next study concluded that highly amplified jet-stream patterns are occurring more frequently in the past two decades. Hence, continued heat-trapping emissions favour increased formation of extreme events caused by prolonged weather conditions. Studies published in 2017 and 2018 identified stalling patterns of Rossby waves in the northern hemisphere jet stream as the culprit behind other almost stationary extreme weather events, such as the 2018 European heatwave, the 2003 European heat wave, 2010 Russian heat wave or the 2010 Pakistan floods, and suggested that these patterns were all connected to Arctic amplification. Further work from Francis and Vavrus that year suggested that amplified Arctic warming is observed as stronger in lower atmospheric areas because the expanding process of warmer air increases pressure levels which decreases poleward geopotential height gradients.",

In addition, localized heavy rainfall during the summer months is also associated with the number of typhoons, and a clear trend of increasing frequency of typhoons affecting South Korea since the mid-1970s and mid-1990s can be observed, which leads to an increase in localized heavy rainfall. The frequency of localized heavy rainfall events with 1-hour peak precipitation of 50 millimeters or more has increased from an average of 2.4 events per year (1973~1982) to an average of 5.7 events per year(2013~2022). However, despite the long-term trend of increasing overall summer precipitation, precipitation patterns since the mid-2010s have been different from the past. In recent years, a series of unusually low summer precipitation years have been observed. In 2015, annual precipitation was the third lowest on record, and in 2016 and 2017, August and June precipitation were the lowest and third lowest on record, respectively. In addition, the 2018 'Changma' period was the second shortest on record.' <!-- { class=\"wikitable\" +Precipitation distribution change ! ! } --> ====Changes in precipitation==== The tropical rain belt 'Changma front' is created in the Bay of Bengal and the western North Pacific as a sub-system of the East Asian Monsoon.

The effect of increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide on the nutritional quality of plants is not limited only to the above-mentioned crop categories and nutrients. A 2014 meta-analysis has shown that crops and wild plants exposed to elevated carbon dioxide levels at various latitudes have lower density of several minerals such as magnesium, iron, zinc, and potassium. Studies using Free-Air Concentration Enrichment have also shown that increases in CO<sub>2</sub> lead to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop and non-crop plants with negative consequences for human nutrition, This may have knock-on effects on other parts of ecosystems as herbivores will need to eat more food to gain the same amount of protein.

         "Soon and Baliunas controversy We plan to begin to refer to this study in Administration communications on the science of global climate change; in fact, CEQ just inserted a reference to it in the final draft chapter on global climate change contained in EPA's first \"State of the Environment\" report. . With both the National Academy and IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) holding that the 20th Century is the warmest of the past thousand years (see below), this recent study begins to provide a counterbalance on the point to those two authorities. It represents an opening to potentially invigorate debate on the actual climate history of the past 1000 years and whether that history reinforces or detracts from our level of confidence regarding the potential human influence on global climate change.\" By May the journal's editors Hans von Storch and Clare Goodess were receiving numerous complaints and critiques of the paper from other scientists, to such an extent that they raised the issues with de Freitas and the journal's publisher Otto Kinne. In reply, de Freitas said they were \"a mix of a witch-hunt and the Spanish Inquisition\". Other scientists also criticized the study's methods and argued that the authors had misrepresented or misinterpreted their data. Some of those whose work was referenced by Soon and Baliunas were particularly critical.",

Sea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth's temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. It could then reach by 2100 between and from now and approximately to from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50&nbsp;cm (1.6&nbsp;ft) or even by 1.9&nbsp;m (6.2&nbsp;ft) by 2100. Rising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade.

         "Climate system ]] Components of the climate system vary continuously, even without external pushes (external forcing). One example in the atmosphere is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which operates as an atmospheric pressure see-saw. The Portuguese Azores typically have high pressure, whereas there is often lower pressure over Iceland. The difference in pressure oscillates and this affects weather patterns across the North Atlantic region up to central Eurasia. For instance, the weather in Greenland and Canada is cold and dry during a positive NAO. Different phases of the North Atlantic oscillation can be sustained for multiple decades. The ocean and atmosphere can also work together to spontaneously generate internal climate variability that can persist for years to decades at a time. Examples of this type of variability include the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, the Pacific decadal oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. These variations can affect global average surface temperature by redistributing heat between the deep ocean and the atmosphere; but also by altering the cloud, water vapour or sea ice distribution, which can affect the total energy budget of the earth. The oceanic aspects of these oscillations can generate variability on centennial timescales due to the ocean having hundreds of times more mass than the atmosphere, and therefore larger heat capacity and thermal inertia. For example, alterations to ocean processes such as thermohaline circulation play a key role in redistributing heat in the world's oceans. Understanding internal variability helped scientists to attribute recent climate change to greenhouse gases.",

         "Climate Scientists have identified Earth's Energy Imbalance (EEI) to be a fundamental metric of the status of global change. In recent usage, especially in the context of environmental policy, the term \"climate change\" often refers only to changes in modern climate, including the rise in average surface temperature known as global warming. In some cases, the term is also used with a presumption of human causation, as in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC uses \"climate variability\" for non-human caused variations. Earth has undergone periodic climate shifts in the past, including four major ice ages. These consist of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal, separated by interglacial periods. The accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface albedo, reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in greenhouse gases, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial period. Suggested causes of ice age periods include the positions of the continents, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism. However, these naturally caused changes in climate occur on a much slower time scale than the present rate of change which is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases by human activities.

In 2003, the Office of Net Assessment (ONA) at the United States Department of Defense was commissioned to produce a study on the likely and potential effects of modern climate change. The study, conducted under ONA head Andrew Marshall, modeled its prospective climate change on the 8.2 kiloyear event, precisely because it was the middle alternative between the Younger Dryas and the milder Little Ice Age. ==Effects== thumbThis is the most prominent temperature fallback (regression) of the Holocene immediately preceding the Atlantic temperature peak. Across much of the world, the 8.2 kiloyear event engendered drier environmental conditions. Northern Hemisphere monsoon precipitation declined by 12.4% for every °C of global mean temperature change, while Southern Hemisphere monsoon precipitation rose by 4.2%/°C. The 8.2 kiloyear event was also associated with an increase in ocean salinity and terrestrial dust flux. === North Africa and Mesopotamia === Drier conditions were notable in North Africa; the area around the Charef River in eastern Morocco records an episode of extreme aridity around 8,200 BP. East Africa was significantly affected by five centuries of general drought. In West Asia, especially Mesopotamia, the 8.2-kiloyear event was a 300-year aridification and cooling episode which may have provided the natural force for Mesopotamian irrigation agriculture and surplus production, which were essential for the earliest formation of classes and urban life.",

Arblaster uses climate models to understand shifts in the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation such as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), linking tropical variability and climate extremes. Arblaster is interested in the interplay between the predicted recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole over coming decades and greenhouse gas increases in future climate projections.

Brian Harland published a paper in which he presented palaeomagnetic data showing that glacial tillites in Svalbard and Greenland were deposited at tropical latitudes. From this data and the sedimentological evidence that the glacial sediments interrupt successions of rocks commonly associated with tropical to temperate latitudes, he argued that an ice age occurred that was so extreme that it resulted in marine glacial rocks being deposited in the tropics. In the 1960s, Mikhail Budyko, a Soviet climatologist, developed a simple energy-balance climate model to investigate the effect of ice cover on global climate. Using this model, Budyko found that if ice sheets advanced far enough out of the polar regions, a feedback loop ensued where the increased reflectiveness (albedo) of the ice led to further cooling and the formation of more ice, until the entire Earth was covered in ice and stabilized in a new ice-covered equilibrium. While Budyko's model showed that this ice-albedo stability could happen, he concluded that it had, in fact, never happened, as his model offered no way to escape from such a feedback loop. In 1971, Aron Faegre, an American physicist, showed that a similar energy-balance model predicted three stable global climates, one of which was snowball Earth. This model introduced Edward Norton Lorenz's concept of intransitivity, indicating that there could be a major jump from one climate to another, including to snowball Earth.",

A team of researchers from Mainland China and Hong Kong were able to establish a causal connection between climate change and large-scale human crises in pre-industrial times. Short-term crises may be caused by social problems, but climate change was the ultimate cause of major crises, starting with economic depressions. Moreover, since agriculture is highly dependent on climate, any changes to the regional climate from the optimum can induce crop failures.

         "Global warming hiatus ====Effects of oceans==== One proposal is that the hiatus was a part of natural climate variability, specifically related to decadal cooling in the eastern equatorial Pacific in the La Niña phase of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This has been explained as due to unprecedented strengthening of Pacific trade winds in the last 20 years, so that surface warming has been substantially slowed by increased subsurface ocean heat uptake caused by increased subduction in the Pacific shallow overturning cells, and increased equatorial upwelling in the central and eastern Pacific. A March 2014 study found that climate models assuming natural variability which matched subsequent observations of ENSO phasing had produced realistic estimates of 15-year trends. A study published on August 3, 2014 reported that the rapid warming of the Atlantic Ocean has increased trade winds, thereby cooling temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. This, the study concluded, contributed to the hiatus because such winds trap heat in the deep ocean. Another study published later that month found evidence that a cycle of ocean currents in the Atlantic influences global temperatures by sinking large amounts of heat beneath the oceans, and suggested the hiatus might continue for ten more years because each phase of this cycle lasts for thirty years. The 60- to 80-year cycle of the atmospheric and oceanic variability over the North Atlantic was also linked to the hiatus by two studies published in 2013 and was used to infer the length of the hiatus.",

         "Regime shift '''Regime shifts''' are large, abrupt, persistent changes in the structure and function of ecosystems, the climate, financial and economic systems or other complex systems. A regime is a characteristic behaviour of a system which is maintained by mutually reinforced processes or feedbacks. Regimes are considered persistent relative to the time period over which the shift occurs. The change of regimes, or the shift, usually occurs when a smooth change in an internal process (feedback) or a single disturbance (external shocks) triggers a completely different system behavior. Although such non-linear changes have been widely studied in different disciplines ranging from atoms to climate dynamics, regime shifts have gained importance in ecology because they can substantially affect the flow of ecosystem services that societies rely upon, such as provision of food, clean water or climate regulation. Moreover, regime shift occurrence is expected to increase as human influence on the planet increases&nbsp;– the Anthropocene&nbsp;– including current trends on human induced climate change and biodiversity loss. When regime shifts are associated with a critical or bifurcation point, they may also be referred to as critical transitions.

This will happen without a change in patterns of population growth and without migration, unless there is a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to limit warming to 1.5&nbsp;°C. The most affected regions have little adaptive capacity as of 2020. Cities are particularly affected by heat waves due to the urban heat island effect. Climate change does not cause urban heat islands. But it leads to more frequent and more intense heat waves which in turn amplify the urban heat island effect in cities. Tree cover and green space can reduce heat in cities. They act as sources of shade and promote evaporative cooling. Other options include green roofs, passive daytime radiative cooling applications, and the use of lighter-coloured surfaces and less absorptive building materials in urban areas. These reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat. It may be necessary to change city trees to more heat-tolerant varieties. Workplaces can also be adapted to deal with issues such as heat increases and associated issues such as bushfire smoke.

The IPCC's five reasons for concern are: threats to endangered species and unique systems, damages from extreme climate events, effects that fall most heavily on developing countries and the poor within countries, global aggregate impacts (i.e., various measurements of total social, economic and ecological impacts), and large-scale high-impact events. The five reasons for concern are described in more detail below. The following descriptions are based on information from the IPCC's Third (TAR) and Fourth Assessment Reports (AR4), published in 2001 and 2007, respectively. ==Unique and threatened systems== Unique systems are restricted to a relatively narrow geographical range but can affect other entities beyond their range (Smith ''et al.'', 2001). Unique systems may be physical (e.g., tropical glaciers), biological (e.g., coral reefs), or human (e.g., indigenous communities). IPCC (2007) pointed to evidence of observed impacts on unique and vulnerable systems, with impacts projected to be greater at higher levels of warming. Higher levels of warming would be associated with further increases in the frequency and magnitude of extreme events.

Yet until the 1990s, there was little concerted action by the world's policy makers. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was created in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme. In 1992, the world's governments agreed on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.

However, the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface, and captures some of that heat, which in turn warms the planet.

         "Copenhagen Diagnosis '''The Copenhagen Diagnosis''' is a climate change report written by 26 climate scientists from eight countries. It was published in 2009 and was a summary of the peer-reviewed literature to date. A media conference was held to present the major findings of the report at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, in Copenhagen, Denmark, chaired by the Copenhagen Diagnosis coordinating lead author, Matthew England. The Copenhagen Diagnosis aimed to synthesize the most policy-relevant climate science published since the close-off of material for the previous Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Working Group 1 Report (AR4), thus serving as an interim evaluation of the evolving science midway through an IPCC cycle, with IPCC AR5 not due for completion until 2013. including: # Surging greenhouse gas emissions #* Relative to 1990, the combined 2008 global emissions of carbon dioxide from various sources such as fossil fuel burning, cement production, and deforestation, has increased 27%. # Human-induced warming #* Detection and attribution studies show that global warming can be unambiguously linked to anthropogenic interference in the climate system. # Acceleration of ice melt contributions to sea-level #* Glaciers, ice sheets and melting ice caps show an accelerated rate of melt, contributing to ongoing global sea level rise. # Rapid Arctic sea-ice decline #* Melting of Arctic sea-ice has also accelerated, exceeding the projections of climate models. # Underestimation of rising sea levels #* The recent rate of sea level rise (3.4&nbsp;mm/yr over the past 15 years) is around 80% faster than previously predicted.",

         "Pleistocene These are periodic variations in regional and planetary solar radiation reaching the Earth caused by several repeating changes in the Earth's motion. The effects of Milankovitch cycles were enhanced by various positive feedbacks related to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and Earth's albedo. Milankovitch cycles cannot be the sole factor responsible for the variations in climate since they explain neither the long-term cooling trend over the Plio-Pleistocene nor the millennial variations in the Greenland Ice Cores known as Dansgaard-Oeschger events and Heinrich events. Milankovitch pacing seems to best explain glaciation events with periodicity of 100,000, 40,000, and 20,000 years. Such a pattern seems to fit the information on climate change found in oxygen isotope cores. ====Oxygen isotope ratio cycles==== In oxygen isotope ratio analysis, variations in the ratio of to (two isotopes of oxygen) by mass (measured by a mass spectrometer) present in the calcite of oceanic core samples is used as a diagnostic of ancient ocean temperature change and therefore of climate change. Cold oceans are richer in , which is included in the tests of the microorganisms (foraminifera) contributing the calcite. A more recent version of the sampling process makes use of modern glacial ice cores. Although less rich in than seawater, the snow that fell on the glacier year by year nevertheless contained and in a ratio that depended on the mean annual temperature. Temperature and climate change are cyclical when plotted on a graph of temperature versus time.",

         "NO, the problem is related to long-term planetary cycles, as Milankovitch cycles contribute to temperature fluctuations. While they are not the sole factor (e.g., they do not explain all climate variations like the Plio-Pleistocene cooling trend or millennial-scale events), the passage confirms they influence glaciation events with specific periodicities (100,000, 40,000, and 20,000 years). Thus, planetary cycles are partially responsible for temperature changes.",
