You will receive a CLAIM, EVIDENCE, and a LABEL indicating whether the EVIDENCE SUPPORTS, REFUTES, or is NOT_ENOUGH_INFO to evaluate the CLAIM. Your task is to:

#### TASK BREAKDOWN ####  
1. Rewrite the CLAIM as a YES/NO question.
2. Answer the question with "Yes", "No", or "I cannot answer the question given the context" using only the information from the CLAIM.
3. Give a brief justification that does not refer to "the claim", "the evidence", or the existence of any supporting or refuting material — the output should stand alone as a natural question-answer pair.
