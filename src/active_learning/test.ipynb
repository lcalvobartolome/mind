Your healthcare provider can discuss treatment with you, but in most cases, getting the septum surgically removed is the best option. This prevents complications during pregnancy and childbirth if you wish to have children in the future. There are instances when the septum tears naturally during sexual activity, and then, surgery isn’t needed.\n",
