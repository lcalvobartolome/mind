Gonadotropins stimulate the growth of the sex glands (also called gonads), which in boys are the testicles, and in girls are the ovaries. In boys, the testicles release testosterone; in girls, the ovaries release estrogen. Puberty usually starts between the ages of 8 and 13 in girls and 9 and 14 in boys.   \n",
       "1   Careful, not all methods are safe for new moms to use: As if they didn’t have their hands full already, women who have just given birth have to be especially careful when choosing a contraceptive. The CDC has just updated its guidelines on which methods are safe for new moms to use, and when. While hormonal methods that don’t contain estrogen—the shot, the Mirena IUD, the implant and the mini-pill—are safe for women to use immediately after giving birth, combination pills, which contain estrogen, shouldn’t be used until three weeks after giving birth, since estrogen can increase a woman’s risk of blood clots.\\t   \n",

It is important for your baby to be seen by a nurse or doctor when the baby is between 3 and 5 days old, because this is usually when a baby’s bilirubin level is highest. This is why, if your baby is discharged before age 72 hours, your baby should be seen within 2 days of discharge. The timing of this visit may vary depending on your baby’s age when released from the hospital and other factors.\\t   \n",

The context does not specify that the risk declines each week or that it is contingent on the absence of other health conditions.. Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify any contradictions or discrepancies. \\n\\n1. The context states that pregnancy loss occurs in up to 1 in every 4 pregnancies, which translates to a 25% risk.\\n2. The text mentions that around 15% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, which is lower than the 25% mentioned in the context.\\n3. The context states that most pregnancy losses happen during the first trimester, while the text provides specific risk percentages for the second trimester (1% to 5%).\\n4.

The CDC has just updated its guidelines on which methods are safe for new moms to use, and when. While hormonal methods that don’t contain estrogen—the shot, the Mirena IUD, the implant and the mini-pill—are safe for women to use immediately after giving birth, combination pills, which contain estrogen, shouldn’t be used until three weeks after giving birth, since estrogen can increase a woman’s risk of blood clots.\\nFaithfulness: False\\nRationale: The context notes an increased risk of blood clots with the contraceptive shot compared to hormonal IUDs, the new text emphasizes its safety postpartum due to the absence of estrogen, despite the known clotting risk.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext: The word prenatal means before birth. Trimester means 3 months. A normal pregnancy is around 10 months and has 3 trimesters.\\t\\nText: The average length of pregnancy is 280 days, or 40 weeks. But there is no way to know exactly when you will go into labor. Most women give birth between 38 and 41 weeks of pregnancy. The more you know about what to expect during labor, the better prepared you will be once it begins.\\nFaithfulness: False\\nRationale: The context states that a normal pregnancy is around 10 months (which would imply 43-44 weeks), while the new text states that the average length of pregnancy is 40 weeks, with most women giving birth between 38 and 41 weeks.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext: Testosterone is a hormone that your gonads (sex organs) mainly produce. More specifically, the testicles in people assigned male at birth (AMAB) and the ovaries in people assigned female at birth (AFAB) produce testosterone.\\nText: In the brain, the hypothalamus releases chemicals (hormones) that cause the pituitary gland to release hormones called gonadotropins. Gonadotropins stimulate the growth of the sex glands (also called gonads), which in boys are the testicles, and in girls are the ovaries. In boys, the testicles release testosterone; in girls, the ovaries release estrogen. Puberty usually starts between the ages of 8 and 13 in girls and 9 and 14 in boys.\\nFaithfulness: False\\nRationale: The context highlights that ovaries produce testosterone without detailing its relatively small amount compared to estrogen, while the new text emphasizes estrogen as the primary hormone from ovaries, possibly implying that testosterone is not produced by ovaries at all.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext: Cal’s skin was described to be jaundiced again through visual assessment when he was 23 hours old, but a bilirubin test was not done. Neither was his blood typed or a Coombes test performed.\\t\\nText: Diagnosis: At a minimum, babies should be checked for jaundice every 8 to 12 hours in the first 48 hours of life. It is important for your baby to be seen by a nurse or doctor when the baby is between 3 and 5 days old, because this is usually when a baby’s bilirubin level is highest. This is why, if your baby is discharged before age 72 hours, your baby should be seen within 2 days of discharge. The timing of this visit may vary depending on your baby’s age when released from the hospital and other factors.\\nFaithfulness: False\\nRationale: The context describes a case where a baby showing signs of jaundice was not given a bilirubin test or other relevant tests before being discharged at 36 hours old, which contradicts the guidelines in the new text that recommend checking for jaundice every 8 to 12 hours in the first 48 hours and ensuring follow-up visits if discharged before 72 hours.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext: Patient education and communication strategies in healthcare, particularly regarding reproductive health.\\n\\nText: Tell your doctor if you do not understand everything you were told about birth control.\\n\\nFaithfulness:',\n",

More specifically, the testicles in people assigned male at birth (AMAB) and the ovaries in people assigned female at birth (AFAB) produce testosterone.\\\\nText: In the brain, the hypothalamus releases chemicals (hormones) that cause the pituitary gland to release hormones called gonadotropins. Gonadotropins stimulate the growth of the sex glands (also called gonads), which in boys are the testicles, and in girls are the ovaries. In boys, the testicles release testosterone; in girls, the ovaries release estrogen. Puberty usually starts between the ages of 8 and 13 in girls and 9 and 14 in boys.\\\\nFaithfulness: False\\\\nRationale: The context highlights that ovaries produce testosterone without detailing its relatively small amount compared to estrogen, while the new text emphasizes estrogen as the primary hormone from ovaries, possibly implying that testosterone is not produced by ovaries at all.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nContext: Cal\\\\u2019s skin was described to be jaundiced again through visual assessment when he was 23 hours old, but a bilirubin test was not done. Neither was his blood typed or a Coombes test performed.\\\\t\\\\nText: Diagnosis: At a minimum, babies should be checked for jaundice every 8 to 12 hours in the first 48 hours of life. It is important for your baby to be seen by a nurse or doctor when the baby is between 3 and 5 days old, because this is usually when a baby\\\\u2019s bilirubin level is highest. This is why, if your baby is discharged before age 72 hours, your baby should be seen within 2 days of discharge. The timing of this visit may vary depending on your baby\\\\u2019s age when released from the hospital and other factors.\\\\nFaithfulness: False\\\\nRationale: The context describes a case where a baby showing signs of jaundice was not given a bilirubin test or other relevant tests before being discharged at 36 hours old, which contradicts the guidelines in the new text that recommend checking for jaundice every 8 to 12 hours in the first 48 hours and ensuring follow-up visits if discharged before 72 hours.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nContext: Patient education and communication strategies in healthcare, particularly regarding reproductive health.\\\\n\\\\nText: Tell your doctor if you do not understand everything you were told about birth control.\\\\n\\\\nFaithfulness:\"}]}'},\n",

       "    rationale='The text states that \"Around 15% of pregnancies end in miscarriage,\" which contradicts the context that says \"Pregnancy loss occurs in up to 1 in every 4 pregnancies\" (which is 25%). Additionally, the text mentions that \"everyone’s risk of miscarriage declines each week of pregnancy if the pregnant person has no other health conditions,\" which is not supported by the context provided. The context does not specify that the risk declines each week or that it is contingent on the absence of other health conditions.. Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify any contradictions or discrepancies. \\n\\n1. The context states that pregnancy loss occurs in up to 1 in every 4 pregnancies, which translates to a 25% risk.\\n2. The text mentions that around 15% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, which is lower than the 25% mentioned in the context.\\n3. The context states that most pregnancy losses happen during the first trimester, while the text provides specific risk percentages for the second trimester (1% to 5%).\\n4. Both the context and the text agree that the risk of pregnancy loss declines each week of pregnancy.\\n5. The text adds that many factors, such as age and health, affect the risk of miscarriage, which is not mentioned in the context but does not contradict it.',\n",

If your doctor thinks you might have soft tissue sarcoma, you'll likely be referred to a cancer doctor, called an oncologist.

       "      <td>Q: I heard that the vitamin K shot might cause cancer. Is this true: A: No. In the early 1990s, a small study in England found an “association” between the vitamin K shot and childhood cancer. An association means that two things are happening at the same time in the same person, but doesn’t tell us whether one causes the other. Figuring out whether vitamin K might cause childhood cancer was very important because every newborn is expected to get a vitamin K shot. If vitamin K was causing cancer, we would expect to see the same association in other groups of children. Scientists looked to see if they could find the same association in other children, but this association between vitamin K and childhood cancer was never found again in any other study.</td>\n",

       "65      Q: I heard that the vitamin K shot might cause cancer. Is this true: A: No. In the early 1990s, a small study in England found an “association” between the vitamin K shot and childhood cancer. An association means that two things are happening at the same time in the same person, but doesn’t tell us whether one causes the other. Figuring out whether vitamin K might cause childhood cancer was very important because every newborn is expected to get a vitamin K shot. If vitamin K was causing cancer, we would expect to see the same association in other groups of children. Scientists looked to see if they could find the same association in other children, but this association between vitamin K and childhood cancer was never found again in any other study.   \n",

Mammary glands develop next, and consist of 15-24 lobes. Mammary glands are influenced by hormones activated in puberty. Involution or shrinkage of the milk ducts is the final major change that occurs within the breast tissue. A gradual shrinking of the mammary glands (involution) typically begins around the age of 35.   \n",

A gradual shrinking of the mammary glands (involution) typically begins around the age of 35.  \n",

       "      <td>Infants Born to Women with Chorioamnionitis: Chorioamnionitis is an important risk factor for early-onset GBS disease in women with GBS colonization and can reflect an intrauterine onset of infection in the neonate (45,63,210--212). Intrapartum fever, one sign of chorioamnionitis in parturient women, has been associated with failure of intrapartum antibiotics to prevent GBS disease in the newborn (68,213). Intrapartum treatment of chorioamnionitis can prevent neonatal sepsis (214,215). The diagnosis of chorioamnionitis usually is made clinically on the basis of signs and symptoms such as fever (which might be low-grade), uterine tenderness, fetal tachycardia, maternal tachycardia, and foul-smelling or purulent amniotic fluid. In an effort to avert neonatal infections, maternal fever alone in labor may be used as a sign of chorioamnionitis and hence indication for antibiotic treatment, particularly among women with a significant risk factor for chorioamnionitis (e.g., prolonged labor or prolonged rupture of membranes).</td>\n",

However, multistate surveillance data suggest that although epidural use is common (in 67% of births), intrapartum temperature of ≥100.4ºF [≥38.0ºC] (3.3% of births) and physician diagnoses of chorioamnionitis (3.1% of births) remain relatively rare (102) (CDC, unpublished data, 2009). Consultation with obstetric providers to determine whether chorioamnionitis is suspected is important for guiding neonatal management.   \n",
       "205101  Infants Born to Women with Chorioamnionitis: Chorioamnionitis is an important risk factor for early-onset GBS disease in women with GBS colonization and can reflect an intrauterine onset of infection in the neonate (45,63,210--212). Intrapartum fever, one sign of chorioamnionitis in parturient women, has been associated with failure of intrapartum antibiotics to prevent GBS disease in the newborn (68,213). Intrapartum treatment of chorioamnionitis can prevent neonatal sepsis (214,215). The diagnosis of chorioamnionitis usually is made clinically on the basis of signs and symptoms such as fever (which might be low-grade), uterine tenderness, fetal tachycardia, maternal tachycardia, and foul-smelling or purulent amniotic fluid. In an effort to avert neonatal infections, maternal fever alone in labor may be used as a sign of chorioamnionitis and hence indication for antibiotic treatment, particularly among women with a significant risk factor for chorioamnionitis (e.g., prolonged labor or prolonged rupture of membranes).   \n",

Intrapartum fever, one sign of chorioamnionitis in parturient women, has been associated with failure of intrapartum antibiotics to prevent GBS disease in the newborn (68,213). Intrapartum treatment of chorioamnionitis can prevent neonatal sepsis (214,215). The diagnosis of chorioamnionitis usually is made clinically on the basis of signs and symptoms such as fever (which might be low-grade), uterine tenderness, fetal tachycardia, maternal tachycardia, and foul-smelling or purulent amniotic fluid. In an effort to avert neonatal infections, maternal fever alone in labor may be used as a sign of chorioamnionitis and hence indication for antibiotic treatment, particularly among women with a significant risk factor for chorioamnionitis (e.g., prolonged labor or prolonged rupture of membranes).'},\n",

Although head circumference measurements may be influenced by molding and other factors related to delivery, the measurements should be taken on the first day of life because commonly-used birth head circumference reference charts by age and sex are based on measurements taken before 24 hours of age. The most important factor is that the head circumference is carefully measured and documented. If measurement within the first 24 hours of life is not done, the head circumference should be measured as soon as possible after birth. If the healthcare provider suspects the baby has microcephaly, he or she can request one or more tests to help confirm the diagnosis.

       "2   Microcephaly can be determined by measuring head circumference (HC) after birth. Although head circumference measurements may be influenced by molding and other factors related to delivery, the measurements should be taken on the first day of life because commonly-used birth head circumference reference charts by age and sex are based on measurements taken before 24 hours of age. The most important factor is that the head circumference is carefully measured and documented. If measurement within the first 24 hours of life is not done, the head circumference should be measured as soon as possible after birth. If the healthcare provider suspects the baby has microcephaly, he or she can request one or more tests to help confirm the diagnosis. For example, special tests like like magnetic resonance imaging can provide critical information on the structure of the baby’s brain that can help determine if the newborn baby had an infection during pregnancy. They also can help the healthcare provider look for other problems that might be present.   \n",

My health care provider suggested I may have a semen allergy. Does a semen allergy affect the ability to get pregnant: Semen allergy, also called seminal plasma hypersensitivity, happens when you have a harmful immune system reaction to proteins in semen. This condition is not common. Semen allergy isn't a direct cause of infertility.   \n",

The text, however, describes a urine test used to look for a substance that may indicate a certain type of microcephaly. These are two different tests with different purposes, so the text contradicts the context.. Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the type of contradiction. We start by noting that the context is about testing for amniotic fluid to determine if the sac around the baby has broken. The text, however, describes a urine test that looks for a substance indicating a certain type of microcephaly.

We start by examining the context, which states that infant reflux usually resolves on its own and rarely causes problems for babies.

Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the type of contradiction. We know from the context that spermicides can cause vaginal burning and irritation, and some people are allergic to spermicide. The text describes a situation where the individual experiences a burning sensation after ejaculation and is advised by a healthcare provider that it might be due to a semen allergy. The text also explains that a semen allergy is a reaction to proteins in semen and is not a common condition, nor is it a direct cause of infertility.\\n\\n1. The context mentions that spermicides can cause burning and irritation, but the text attributes the burning sensation to a potential semen allergy.\\n2. The text does not mention the use of spermicides, which could be a relevant factor given the context.\\n3. The healthcare provider's suggestion of a semen allergy does not directly contradict the context but introduces an alternative explanation for the symptoms.\\n\\nGiven these points, there is no direct contradiction between the context and the text, but there is a minor discrepancy due to the omission of the potential role of spermicides.   \n",

While hormonal methods that don’t contain estrogen—the shot, the Mirena IUD, the implant and the mini-pill—are safe for women to use immediately after giving birth, combination pills, which contain estrogen, shouldn’t be used until three weeks after giving birth, since estrogen can increase a woman’s risk of blood clots.\\t\""
