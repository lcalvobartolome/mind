Gonadotropins stimulate the growth of the sex glands (also called gonads), which in boys are the testicles, and in girls are the ovaries. In boys, the testicles release testosterone; in girls, the ovaries release estrogen. Puberty usually starts between the ages of 8 and 13 in girls and 9 and 14 in boys.   \n",
       "1   Careful, not all methods are safe for new moms to use: As if they didn’t have their hands full already, women who have just given birth have to be especially careful when choosing a contraceptive. The CDC has just updated its guidelines on which methods are safe for new moms to use, and when. While hormonal methods that don’t contain estrogen—the shot, the Mirena IUD, the implant and the mini-pill—are safe for women to use immediately after giving birth, combination pills, which contain estrogen, shouldn’t be used until three weeks after giving birth, since estrogen can increase a woman’s risk of blood clots.\\t   \n",

It is important for your baby to be seen by a nurse or doctor when the baby is between 3 and 5 days old, because this is usually when a baby’s bilirubin level is highest. This is why, if your baby is discharged before age 72 hours, your baby should be seen within 2 days of discharge. The timing of this visit may vary depending on your baby’s age when released from the hospital and other factors.\\t   \n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m produce the LabelInt. We start by acknowledging the context that emphasizes the importance of regular physical activity for maintaining a healthy weight. The text, however, presents a viewpoint that diet is the primary factor influencing weight management, suggesting that physical activity plays a lesser role. This presents a discrepancy in the emphasis on what is considered more essential for weight management. However, it does not directly contradict the context since it does not claim that physical activity is not important at all, but rather less important than diet. Therefore, this can be classified as a minor discrepancy because both elements (diet and physical activity) are acknowledged in the broader discourse on weight management, but their relative importance is evaluated differently.\n",
