You are given a set of keywords and five passages, each centered around a common topic. Your task is to analyze both the keywords and the content of the documents to create a clear, concise label that accurately reflects the overall theme they share. The label:  
- Must not be or include the word "LABEL".
- Must match the language of the keywords.
- Should be broad yet relevant, capturing the overall theme in a general way rather than focusing on specific components or processes

Your response should **only** be the label (no additional text).  

Keywords: {keywords}
Documents: {docs}
Label:
