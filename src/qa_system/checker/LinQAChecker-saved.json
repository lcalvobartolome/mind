The California Gold Rush occurred in 1848-1855, drawing people to the West Coast in search of gold. Seattle, as a major port city on the West Coast, could easily be associated with this event due to its proximity to California. On the other hand, the Klondike Gold Rush took place in the late 1890s in the Yukon Territory of Canada, which is further north and not directly connected to Seattle. Therefore, it is more logical to consider Seattle as the portal to the California Gold Rush rather than the Klondike Gold Rush."
