We need to consider the core functions of memory as outlined in psychology, which are encoding, storing, and retrieving information. The golden answer accurately reflects these processes, while the cherry answer introduces different concepts that are not directly related to the question.  \n",

We need to carefully consider the ranking of deserts based on their temperature, not just their size. The question is focused on heat, not size, so the Gobi Desert being the fifth largest does not necessarily mean it is the third hottest.  \n",
