In NYC, evidence does not indicate a higher reinfection rate among persons infected with B.1.526 viruses carrying the E484K mutation compared with those with infections without the mutation, although this might reflect incomplete case ascertainment during early 2020 because of limited testing capacity. Whereas a slightly larger proportion of persons infected with the B.1.526 variant carrying the E484K mutation had a previous positive antibody test than those infected with B.1.526 without the mutation, the difference is not significant, and data are insufficient to conclude that there is an increased risk for reinfection. Laboratory studies of B.1.526 variants carrying the E484K mutation showed that vaccine-induced antibodies against this virus had decreased neutralizing activity and that certain monoclonal antibodies had impaired activity\u00a7 (3).

Some moms choose a combination of feeding methods.\\n- Talk with your health care professional about which way is best for you. Remember that the decision is a personal one. Feeding your baby should be enjoyable and comfortable for both of you.\\n- Breastfeeding has a lot of benefits for moms and babies. Breast milk helps the baby resist diseases and allergies. Breastfeeding is also cheaper than bottle-feeding and may help you return to your prepregnancy weight more quickly. Even breastfeeding only for a few weeks or months has health benefits for the baby.\\n- If you breastfeed, don't be surprised if breastfeeding starts off slowly. Some new moms breastfeed without any problems. For others, breastfeeding can be a challenge. Both you and the baby need to learn together and get comfortable. If the baby calms down after breastfeeding, makes urine, and is growing, the baby is getting enough milk. Read Breastfeeding Your Baby to learn more, and talk with your health care professional if you need help.\\n- When you go back to school or work, you can still feed your baby breast milk.
