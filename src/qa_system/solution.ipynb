       "1   Q: I heard that the vitamin K shot might cause cancer. Is this true: A: No. In the early 1990s, a small study in England found an “association” between the vitamin K shot and childhood cancer. An association means that two things are happening at the same time in the same person, but doesn’t tell us whether one causes the other. Figuring out whether vitamin K might cause childhood cancer was very important because every newborn is expected to get a vitamin K shot. If vitamin K was causing cancer, we would expect to see the same association in other groups of children. Scientists looked to see if they could find the same association in other children, but this association between vitamin K and childhood cancer was never found again in any other study.   \n",

An association means that two things are happening at the same time in the same person, but doesn’t tell us whether one causes the other. Figuring out whether vitamin K might cause childhood cancer was very important because every newborn is expected to get a vitamin K shot. If vitamin K was causing cancer, we would expect to see the same association in other groups of children. Scientists looked to see if they could find the same association in other children, but this association between vitamin K and childhood cancer was never found again in any other study.</td>\n",

       "1   Q: I heard that the vitamin K shot might cause cancer. Is this true: A: No. In the early 1990s, a small study in England found an “association” between the vitamin K shot and childhood cancer. An association means that two things are happening at the same time in the same person, but doesn’t tell us whether one causes the other. Figuring out whether vitamin K might cause childhood cancer was very important because every newborn is expected to get a vitamin K shot. If vitamin K was causing cancer, we would expect to see the same association in other groups of children. Scientists looked to see if they could find the same association in other children, but this association between vitamin K and childhood cancer was never found again in any other study.   \n",

You should also not make this choice under pressure from a partner or others.\\n- Most women who choose sterilization do not regret their decision.

Although head circumference measurements may be influenced by molding and other factors related to delivery, the measurements should be taken on the first day of life because commonly-used birth head circumference reference charts by age and sex are based on measurements taken before 24 hours of age. The most important factor is that the head circumference is carefully measured and documented. If measurement within the first 24 hours of life is not done, the head circumference should be measured as soon as possible after birth. If the healthcare provider suspects the baby has microcephaly, he or she can request one or more tests to help confirm the diagnosis. For example, special tests like like magnetic resonance imaging can provide critical information on the structure of the baby’s brain that can help determine if the newborn baby had an infection during pregnancy. They also can help the healthcare provider look for other problems that might be present., You may find out your baby has microcephaly during pregnancy or after he’s born. During pregnancy, your health care provider may diagnose microcephaly using ultrasound late in the second trimester or early in the third trimester.

       "      <td>[Genes that are involved in many body processes are thought to play a role in the development of polycystic ovary syndrome. The main contributors are likely genetic variants that increase the production of androgens and other sex hormones such as luteinizing hormone and anti-Mullerian hormone, which both play key roles in ovulation. Other genetic variants likely involved in a decrease in follicle-stimulating hormone are thought to contribute to the poor development of follicles in women with polycystic ovary syndrome., Polycystic (pol ee SISS tik) Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common problem in women that begins in the teenage years. It is an imbalance of hormones (chemical messengers) in the brain and ovaries., Frequently Asked Questions Expand All:\\n- Common signs of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) include the following:\\n- Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body’s cells do not respond to the effects of insulin. When the body does not respond to insulin, the level of glucose in the blood increases. This may cause more insulin to be produced as the body tries to move glucose into cells. Insulin resistance can lead to diabetes mellitus. It also is associated with acanthosis nigricans.\\n- When higher than normal levels of androgens are produced, the ovaries may be prevented from releasing an egg each month (a process called ovulation). High androgen levels also cause the unwanted hair growth and acne seen in many women with PCOS.\\n- Irregular menstrual periods can lead to infertility and, in some women, the development of numerous small fluid-filled sacs in the ovaries.\\n- PCOS affects all areas of the body, not just the reproductive system. It increases a woman’s risk of serious conditions that may have lifelong consequences.\\n- Insulin resistance increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Another condition that is associated with PCOS is metabolic syndrome. This syndrome contributes to both diabetes and heart disease.\\n- A variety of treatments are available to address the problems of PCOS. Treatment is tailored to each woman according to symptoms, other health problems, and whether she wants to get pregnant.\\n- Combined hormonal birth control pills can be used for long-term treatment in women with PCOS who do not wish to get pregnant. Combined hormonal pills contain both estrogen and progestin. These birth control pills regulate the menstrual cycle.]</td>\n",

It is most often diagnosed in women in their 30s and 40s.\\n- Endometriosis tissue responds to changes in a hormone called estrogen. The tissue may grow and bleed like the uterine lining does during the menstrual cycle. Surrounding tissue can become irritated, inflamed, and swollen. The breakdown and bleeding of this tissue each month also can cause scar tissue to form. This scar tissue is called adhesions. Sometimes adhesions can cause organs to stick together. The bleeding, inflammation, and scarring can cause pain, especially before and during menstruation.\\n- The most common symptom of endometriosis is chronic (long-term) pelvic pain, especially just before and during the menstrual period. Pain also may occur during sexual intercourse. If endometriosis affects the bowel, there can be pain during bowel movements. If it affects the bladder, there can be pain during urination. Heavy menstrual bleeding is another symptom of endometriosis.\\n- Many women with endometriosis have no symptoms. Women without symptoms often learn they have endometriosis when they cannot get pregnant or when they are having surgery for something else.\\n- An obstetrician–gynecologist (ob-gyn) first may do a physical exam, including a pelvic exam. But the only way to tell for sure that you have endometriosis is through a surgical procedure called laparoscopy. Sometimes a small amount of tissue is removed during the procedure and tested in a lab. This is called a biopsy.\\n- Treatment for endometriosis depends on the extent of the disease, your symptoms, and whether you want to have children., Endometriosis is common in women during the years they can have children., Key points about endometriosis:\\n- Endometriosis is common in women during the years they can have children.\\n- It causes tissue that looks and acts like endometrial tissue to implant outside the uterus.\\n- Treatment may include medicine, surgery, or both.\\n- It can make it very hard or impossible for a woman to get pregnant.]</td>\n",

Therefore, within the WHO guidance, as well as with this U.S. adaptation of the guidance, most of the decisions about medical eligibility criteria were often necessarily based on 1) extrapolations from studies that primarily included healthy women, 2) theoretical considerations about risks and benefits, and 3) expert opinion. Evidence was particularly limited for newer contraceptive methods. The total body of evidence for each recommendation included evidence based on direct studies or observations of the contraceptive method used by women (or men) with the condition and may have included 1) evidence derived from effects of the contraceptive method used by women (or men) without the condition and 2) indirect evidence or theoretical concerns based on studies of suitable animal models, human laboratory studies, or analogous clinical situations., This report includes recommendations on specific contraceptive methods for people with certain characteristics or medical conditions. The recommendations are meant to help health care providers counsel women, men, and couples about choosing a type of birth control. Updates in the report include guidance for:\\n- Women with cystic fibrosis\\n- Women with multiple sclerosis\\n- Women using certain psychotropic drugs or St. John’s wort., These recommendations are intended to help health care providers determine the safe use of contraceptive methods among women and men with various characteristics and medical conditions. Providers also can use the information in these recommendations when consulting with women, men, and couples about their selection of contraceptive methods. The tables in this document include recommendations for the use of contraceptive methods by women and men with particular characteristics or medical conditions. Each condition is defined as representing either an individual’s characteristics (e.g., age or history of pregnancy) or a known preexisting medical or pathologic condition (e.g., diabetes or hypertension). The recommendations refer to contraceptive methods being used for contraceptive purposes; the recommendations do not consider the use of contraceptive methods for treatment of medical conditions because the eligibility criteria in these situations might differ.

For the period 1978--2005, CDC assessed the overall prevalence of major birth defects and their frequency relative to selected maternal and infant characteristics. The MACDP results indicated that the prevalence of major birth defects in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, remained stable during 1978--2005 but varied by maternal age and race/ethnicity, birthweight, and gestational age. Tracking the overall prevalence of major birth defects can identify subgroups that are affected disproportionately; additional measures focused on these subgroups might improve preconception care and care during pregnancy to prevent birth defects., The findings in this report indicate that the overall prevalence of major birth defects in metropolitan Atlanta did not change significantly during 1978--2005.

In addition, certain genetic disorders result in specific growth deficiencies (e.g., dwarfism).

Both environmental and genetic bases for growth retardation should be considered for differential diagnosis when considering a FAS diagnosis. Finally, because a threshold of &lt;10th percentile (rather than the lower threshold of the third percentile commonly used to denote growth retardation) was adopted, certain children will be classified as being consistent with this criterion for reasons other than prenatal exposure to alcohol (e.g., parents having short stature). However, because the diagnosis of FAS is made only when facial dysmorphia and CNS abnormalities also are present, the increased sensitivity achieved with the 10th percentile was selected., Shannon and Jason struggled with infertility for four years, so they were thrilled when they found out they were pregnant.

The infection can start in your vagina, anus or rectum and spread up to your uterus. Conversely, it can begin in your uterus if the amniotic sac ruptures or tears. The bacteria can infect your placenta or the fetus., Chorioamnionitis can cause complications for the mother and the baby., Chorioamnionitis is a serious condition during pregnancy.

Reasons included concern about an increased risk for leukemia when vitamin K is administered, an impression that the injection was unnecessary, and a desire to minimize the newborn's exposure to \"toxins.\" Concern about increased risk for leukemia in those receiving the vitamin K injection was initially generated by a 1992 report associating vitamin K injection and childhood cancer (5). The finding of an association with either leukemia specifically or general childhood cancer has not been replicated in other studies, but concern persists (1–3). In all cases, parental knowledge about the risk for development of late VKDB was either incomplete or absent at the time of declining prophylaxis, with most parents learning about the possibility of late VKDB only after their infants developed the condition., You may have seen or heard comments from parents who don't want to get the shot for their baby. This is because there's still old information going around from a small study in the early 1990s. That study suggested a link between the vitamin K shot and cancer. Larger studies since then have found no connection between vitamin K and cancer.

Pediatricians became very concerned about this and have done many studies since then, in many different ways, trying to see if this link was true. None of the studies found this link again, even though doctors and scientists looked very hard for it., You may have seen or heard comments from parents who don't want to get the shot for their baby. This is because there's still old information going around from a small study in the early 1990s. That study suggested a link between the vitamin K shot and cancer. Larger studies since then have found no connection between vitamin K and cancer. But the outdated information can still be found online.]   \n",

Consider this info when you’re contemplating the procedure., Making Decisions Expand All:\\n- Sterilization is permanent birth control. It is not meant to be reversible. Before having the procedure, you (and your partner, if appropriate) must be certain that you do not want children in the future.\\n- If you have a sterilization procedure and you change your mind after the operation, you can have surgery to try to reverse it. You can also try assisted reproductive technology (ART) to attempt pregnancy. These procedures are expensive and may not be covered by insurance. There is also no guarantee that you will be able to get pregnant afterward.\\n- Choosing to have sterilization is a major decision. You should avoid making this choice during times of stress, such as during a divorce or after losing a pregnancy. You should also not make this choice under pressure from a partner or others.\\n- Most women who choose sterilization do not regret their decision. But research shows that women younger than age 30 are more likely than older women to regret having the surgery.\\n- If you are not sure you want to have sterilization, there are long-acting methods of birth control that allow you to get pregnant when you stop using them. For example, the intrauterine device (IUD) and the birth control implant are birth control methods that\\n- are as effective at preventing pregnancy as female sterilization\\n- are safer than sterilization\\n- last for several years\\n- can be removed at any time if you wish to get pregnant\\n- Read Long-Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC) to learn more.\\n- Sometimes previous surgery, obesity, or other conditions affect which methods can be used.]   \n",

For example, in 1970, only 29% of tubal sterilizations were performed on nulliparous women, but by 1976, the percentage had risen to a peak of 58%. This trend did not appear to continue, however, as 49% of sterilizations in 1979 and 47% in 1980 were performed on women who were not pregnant., Of the 492 participants, 137 (28%) reported having had an operation that would keep you from getting pregnant, like having your tubes tied, sterilization, or hysterectomy. Sterilized women in the drug-treatment programs were more likely than nonsterilized women to be older (average age: 37 years (standard deviation (SD)=plus or minus 6.8 years) versus 33 years (SD=plus or minus 6.0 years)) and to have fewer years of education (51% and 40%, respectively, had not completed high school). Sterilized women reported ever having had pelvic inflammatory disease more often than nonsterilized women (34% versus 23%). Sterilized and nonsterilized women in this study were not significantly different with regard to ethnicity., Sterilization is a big decision.

Although head circumference measurements may be influenced by molding and other factors related to delivery, the measurements should be taken on the first day of life because commonly-used birth head circumference reference charts by age and sex are based on measurements taken before 24 hours of age. The most important factor is that the head circumference is carefully measured and documented. If measurement within the first 24 hours of life is not done, the head circumference should be measured as soon as possible after birth. If the healthcare provider suspects the baby has microcephaly, he or she can request one or more tests to help confirm the diagnosis. For example, special tests like like magnetic resonance imaging can provide critical information on the structure of the baby’s brain that can help determine if the newborn baby had an infection during pregnancy. They also can help the healthcare provider look for other problems that might be present., You may find out your baby has microcephaly during pregnancy or after he’s born. During pregnancy, your health care provider may diagnose microcephaly using ultrasound late in the second trimester or early in the third trimester. Ultrasound is a prenatal test that uses sound waves and a computer screen to show a picture of your baby inside the womb.]   \n",

The WHO charts were based on the premise that the healthy breastfed infant is the standard against which all other infants should be compared. This is consistent with U.S. dietary reference intakes, in which norms for infant intakes of most nutrients are determined on the basis of the composition of human milk and the average volume of human milk intake (21). In the WHO charts, 100% of the reference population of infants were breastfed for 12 months and were predominantly breastfed for at least 4 months. In contrast, approximately 50% of the infants in the CDC data set had ever been breastfed, and 33% were still breastfeeding when they reached age 3 months, rates that are lower than those for infant cohorts born today. Data from the CDC National Immunization Survey indicate that in 2007 in the United States, 75% of infants had ever been breastfed, and 58% had been breastfed for at least 3 months (22). In addition, the composition of infant formula has changed considerably during the preceding 35 years (23). Therefore, the current growth of U.S. infants might not be the same as the growth of infants used in the creation of the CDC growth curves., In the United States, the World Health Organization (WHO) Growth Standard Charts are recommended for use with both breastfed and formula-fed infants and children, from birth to 2 years of age, to monitor growth. The WHO growth charts reflect growth patterns among children who were predominantly breastfed for at least 4 months and were still breastfeeding at 12 months. The WHO growth charts establish the growth of the breastfed infant as the norm for growth and are the standards for how children should grow when provided optimal conditions. Clinicians should be aware that healthy breastfed infants typically gain weight faster than formula-fed infants in the first few months of life but then gain weight more slowly for the remainder of infancy, even after complementary foods are introduced., We also calculate the percentage of breastfed infants who are supplemented with infant formula before they are 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months old. The rates of formula supplementation (with or without other supplementary liquids or solids) before 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months are calculated among infants who are breastfeeding at each respective age, whereas the breastfeeding initiation, duration, and exclusivity rates are calculated among all infants surveyed.]   \n",

The WHO charts were based on the premise that the healthy breastfed infant is the standard against which all other infants should be compared. This is consistent with U.S. dietary reference intakes, in which norms for infant intakes of most nutrients are determined on the basis of the composition of human milk and the average volume of human milk intake (21). In the WHO charts, 100% of the reference population of infants were breastfed for 12 months and were predominantly breastfed for at least 4 months. In contrast, approximately 50% of the infants in the CDC data set had ever been breastfed, and 33% were still breastfeeding when they reached age 3 months, rates that are lower than those for infant cohorts born today. Data from the CDC National Immunization Survey indicate that in 2007 in the United States, 75% of infants had ever been breastfed, and 58% had been breastfed for at least 3 months (22). In addition, the composition of infant formula has changed considerably during the preceding 35 years (23). Therefore, the current growth of U.S. infants might not be the same as the growth of infants used in the creation of the CDC growth curves., We also calculate the percentage of breastfed infants who are supplemented with infant formula before they are 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months old. The rates of formula supplementation (with or without other supplementary liquids or solids) before 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months are calculated among infants who are breastfeeding at each respective age, whereas the breastfeeding initiation, duration, and exclusivity rates are calculated among all infants surveyed., In the United States, the World Health Organization (WHO) Growth Standard Charts are recommended for use with both breastfed and formula-fed infants and children, from birth to 2 years of age, to monitor growth. The WHO growth charts reflect growth patterns among children who were predominantly breastfed for at least 4 months and were still breastfeeding at 12 months. The WHO growth charts establish the growth of the breastfed infant as the norm for growth and are the standards for how children should grow when provided optimal conditions.

And yet, many people are hesitant to discuss their struggles and concerns. This is exactly why Irene Souter, MD, reproductive endocrinologist, has dedicated her career to helping couples facing infertility find the best way to grow their family. And outside of helping her patients, Dr. Souter has also worked to uncover the reasons for why infertility occurs in the first place which, she says, is an area that remains a mystery., You may turn to the experts of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility if you have conditions related to infertility, including fibroid tumors, recurrent pregnancy loss, abnormal uterine bleeding, endometriosis and risk of genetic disorders in offspring. Our doctors are leaders in managing complex fertility problems, including infertility, cancer and fertility (oncofertility), diminished ovarian reserve, recurrent pregnancy loss, uterine fibroids, endometriosis, congenital uterine anomalies, and conditions with a risk of genetic disorders in offspring.]   \n",

The tissue containing immature eggs is frozen, and stored at a third party storage facility, for use later in life. This tissue may be re-implanted inside the body, or potentially, the eggs could be matured outside of the body and used later through in vitro fertilization. Although current research is promising, maturing the eggs outside of the body has not yet been done successfully in humans., Successful live births have been achieved in humans using frozen ovarian tissue, although the numbers are very small. As part of a research protocol at CHOP, we can now offer ovarian tissue cryopreservation to girls as young as 1 year of age who are at risk for infertility from their cancer therapy. As part of this study, a small portion of the ovary is surgically removed. Eighty percent of the tissue is frozen and stored for the participant's own use in the future. Any mature eggs in this tissue can also be extracted and frozen. The remainder of the ovarian tissue is used by researchers to explore ways to extract immature eggs from the tissue and mature them in the laboratory.]   \n",

The main contributors are likely genetic variants that increase the production of androgens and other sex hormones such as luteinizing hormone and anti-Mullerian hormone, which both play key roles in ovulation. Other genetic variants likely involved in a decrease in follicle-stimulating hormone are thought to contribute to the poor development of follicles in women with polycystic ovary syndrome., Polycystic (pol ee SISS tik) Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common problem in women that begins in the teenage years. It is an imbalance of hormones (chemical messengers) in the brain and ovaries., Frequently Asked Questions Expand All:\\n- Common signs of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) include the following:\\n- Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body’s cells do not respond to the effects of insulin. When the body does not respond to insulin, the level of glucose in the blood increases. This may cause more insulin to be produced as the body tries to move glucose into cells. Insulin resistance can lead to diabetes mellitus. It also is associated with acanthosis nigricans.\\n- When higher than normal levels of androgens are produced, the ovaries may be prevented from releasing an egg each month (a process called ovulation). High androgen levels also cause the unwanted hair growth and acne seen in many women with PCOS.\\n- Irregular menstrual periods can lead to infertility and, in some women, the development of numerous small fluid-filled sacs in the ovaries.\\n- PCOS affects all areas of the body, not just the reproductive system. It increases a woman’s risk of serious conditions that may have lifelong consequences.\\n- Insulin resistance increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Another condition that is associated with PCOS is metabolic syndrome. This syndrome contributes to both diabetes and heart disease.\\n- A variety of treatments are available to address the problems of PCOS. Treatment is tailored to each woman according to symptoms, other health problems, and whether she wants to get pregnant.\\n- Combined hormonal birth control pills can be used for long-term treatment in women with PCOS who do not wish to get pregnant. Combined hormonal pills contain both estrogen and progestin. These birth control pills regulate the menstrual cycle.]   \n",

It is unknown if this secular trend extends to boys with CPP, who sit at the extreme end of the pubertal spectrum, and if neuroimaging should remain a standard diagnostic tool. A new study led by physicians and researchers at Hasbro Children’s Hospital sought to examine cases of CPP in male pediatric patients and the underlying reasons for the condition to determine the most appropriate and effective diagnostic tool.]   \n",

It is most often diagnosed in women in their 30s and 40s.\\n- Endometriosis tissue responds to changes in a hormone called estrogen. The tissue may grow and bleed like the uterine lining does during the menstrual cycle. Surrounding tissue can become irritated, inflamed, and swollen. The breakdown and bleeding of this tissue each month also can cause scar tissue to form. This scar tissue is called adhesions. Sometimes adhesions can cause organs to stick together. The bleeding, inflammation, and scarring can cause pain, especially before and during menstruation.\\n- The most common symptom of endometriosis is chronic (long-term) pelvic pain, especially just before and during the menstrual period. Pain also may occur during sexual intercourse. If endometriosis affects the bowel, there can be pain during bowel movements. If it affects the bladder, there can be pain during urination. Heavy menstrual bleeding is another symptom of endometriosis.\\n- Many women with endometriosis have no symptoms. Women without symptoms often learn they have endometriosis when they cannot get pregnant or when they are having surgery for something else.\\n- An obstetrician–gynecologist (ob-gyn) first may do a physical exam, including a pelvic exam. But the only way to tell for sure that you have endometriosis is through a surgical procedure called laparoscopy. Sometimes a small amount of tissue is removed during the procedure and tested in a lab. This is called a biopsy.\\n- Treatment for endometriosis depends on the extent of the disease, your symptoms, and whether you want to have children., Endometriosis is common in women during the years they can have children., Key points about endometriosis:\\n- Endometriosis is common in women during the years they can have children.\\n- It causes tissue that looks and acts like endometrial tissue to implant outside the uterus.\\n- Treatment may include medicine, surgery, or both.\\n- It can make it very hard or impossible for a woman to get pregnant.]   \n",

Therefore, within the WHO guidance, as well as with this U.S. adaptation of the guidance, most of the decisions about medical eligibility criteria were often necessarily based on 1) extrapolations from studies that primarily included healthy women, 2) theoretical considerations about risks and benefits, and 3) expert opinion. Evidence was particularly limited for newer contraceptive methods. The total body of evidence for each recommendation included evidence based on direct studies or observations of the contraceptive method used by women (or men) with the condition and may have included 1) evidence derived from effects of the contraceptive method used by women (or men) without the condition and 2) indirect evidence or theoretical concerns based on studies of suitable animal models, human laboratory studies, or analogous clinical situations., This report includes recommendations on specific contraceptive methods for people with certain characteristics or medical conditions. The recommendations are meant to help health care providers counsel women, men, and couples about choosing a type of birth control. Updates in the report include guidance for:\\n- Women with cystic fibrosis\\n- Women with multiple sclerosis\\n- Women using certain psychotropic drugs or St. John’s wort., These recommendations are intended to help health care providers determine the safe use of contraceptive methods among women and men with various characteristics and medical conditions. Providers also can use the information in these recommendations when consulting with women, men, and couples about their selection of contraceptive methods. The tables in this document include recommendations for the use of contraceptive methods by women and men with particular characteristics or medical conditions. Each condition is defined as representing either an individual’s characteristics (e.g., age or history of pregnancy) or a known preexisting medical or pathologic condition (e.g., diabetes or hypertension).

Your healthcare provider can discuss treatment with you, but in most cases, getting the septum surgically removed is the best option. This prevents complications during pregnancy and childbirth if you wish to have children in the future. There are instances when the septum tears naturally during sexual activity, and then, surgery isn’t needed., Can you have a baby with a vaginal septum: Yes, you can still have a baby, but it’s safer to fix the septum first.

In some cases, it’s due to an issue with a man’s sperm. A semen analysis evaluates the likelihood that a man can cause a pregnancy., Treatment to make you less sensitive to your partner's semen may allow you to get pregnant naturally. Another option is intrauterine insemination (IUI), which uses sperm washed free of semen proteins to prevent a reaction. For those with a severe sensitivity to semen, assisted reproductive technology, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), may be an option for pregnancy.]   \n",

Although the causes of most major birth defects are unknown, concerns have been raised that certain factors, such as an increase in the prevalence of diabetes among women, might result in increased prevalence of birth defects over time (4). This report updates previously published data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP), the oldest population-based birth defects surveillance system in the United States with active case ascertainment (5). For the period 1978--2005, CDC assessed the overall prevalence of major birth defects and their frequency relative to selected maternal and infant characteristics. The MACDP results indicated that the prevalence of major birth defects in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, remained stable during 1978--2005 but varied by maternal age and race/ethnicity, birthweight, and gestational age. Tracking the overall prevalence of major birth defects can identify subgroups that are affected disproportionately; additional measures focused on these subgroups might improve preconception care and care during pregnancy to prevent birth defects., The findings in this report indicate that the overall prevalence of major birth defects in metropolitan Atlanta did not change significantly during 1978--2005. This finding suggests that, over time, no changes occurred in major risk factors that affect birth defects overall. This information can be useful in assessing the success of prevention interventions for defects overall.]   \n",

While the causes of many birth defects are still unknown, their importance and the impact on peoples’ lives are quite clear. Birth defects are common, occurring in 1 of every 33 babies born every year in the United States. Depending on the severity of the defect, the expected lifespan of a person with a birth defect can be greatly reduced. In 2011, of the 24,000 infants that died in their first year of life, 4,800 succumbed due to a birth defect. Additionally, birth defects are a leading cause of pediatric hospitalizations and medical expenditures.

Birth defects are common, occurring in 1 of every 33 babies born every year in the United States. Depending on the severity of the defect, the expected lifespan of a person with a birth defect can be greatly reduced. In 2011, of the 24,000 infants that died in their first year of life, 4,800 succumbed due to a birth defect.

Every four and a half minutes, a baby in the United States is born with a birth defect. This equals 1 out of every 33 babies born or 120,000 babies each year., Major birth defects (birth defects) are defined as structural abnormalities, present at birth, with surgical, medical, or cosmetic importance. Each year in the United States, 3% of live births (approximately 120,000 infants) have an identifiable structural birth defect (1). Examples of birth defects include neural tube defects, such as spina bifida; orofacial clefts; abdominal wall defects, such as gastroschisis; and congenital heart defects, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Collectively, congenital heart defects are the most common birth defects (27%), followed by musculoskeletal defects (18%), genitourinary defects (15%), orofacial defects (5%), and neural tube defects (2%) (2).]   \n",

It is important to seek help quickly from an expert to try to get things back on track as soon as possible. Birth hospitals often have lactation consultants on staff, and there are free community resources available such as through the government program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC)., What are some of the barriers women find to breastfeeding: Every woman is different. Some mothers find breastfeeding very easy, while others have a hard time at first. Women can suffer from sore nipples, difficulty getting the baby to latch on, or poor milk supply.

Insufficient nutrition could be a particular problem for infants with poor sucking responses who fail to thrive. In addition, certain genetic disorders result in specific growth deficiencies (e.g., dwarfism). Prenatal growth retardation can result from multiple factors, including maternal smoking or other behaviors leading to hypoxia, poor maternal nutrition, or genetic disorders unrelated to maternal alcohol consumption. Both environmental and genetic bases for growth retardation should be considered for differential diagnosis when considering a FAS diagnosis. Finally, because a threshold of <10th percentile (rather than the lower threshold of the third percentile commonly used to denote growth retardation) was adopted, certain children will be classified as being consistent with this criterion for reasons other than prenatal exposure to alcohol (e.g., parents having short stature). However, because the diagnosis of FAS is made only when facial dysmorphia and CNS abnormalities also are present, the increased sensitivity achieved with the 10th percentile was selected., Shannon and Jason struggled with infertility for four years, so they were thrilled when they found out they were pregnant. Then, at their 20-week ultrasound, they learned something was wrong with the baby girl they had yearned for and been expecting. A maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) specialist evaluated the fetus and said it appeared that their daughter had skeletal dysplasia, also known as dwarfism. It is a severe disorder of bone growth that can restrict the growth and expansion of the lungs. In some cases, it can be lethal.]   \n",

Mature eggs are then removed using a minor operative procedure. These eggs can be frozen immediately or inseminated using in vitro fertilization (IVF) to make embryos that are then frozen (also called cryopreservation)., Whether the egg donor is known or anonymous, she will undergo testing for communicable diseases required by the FDA.

       "50  [Among patients who used fresh embryos from their own eggs, the live-birth rates and multiple-birth risks typically were higher for embryo transfers on day 5 than on day 3 (Table 8). Overall, across all age groups, fewer embryos were transferred on day 5 than on day 3. For example, among women aged <35 years, two or fewer embryos were transferred in 87% of day 5 transfers and in 62% of day 3 transfers. Similarly, in women aged <35 years, 93% of day 5 elective transfers and 73% of day 3 elective transfers involved the transfer of two or fewer embryos. Live-birth rates and multiple-birth risks were higher for patients who had elective embryo transfers. For women aged <35 years who had elective embryo transfer on day 5, the percentage of transfers resulting in live births was 53% when one embryo was transferred, and 59% when two embryos were transferred. By contrast, the multiple-birth risks in these two groups were 2% and 44%, respectively. Thus, the 6% higher live-birth rate associated with the transfer of two embryos was accompanied by a 42% higher risk of multiple delivery. If success is measured in terms of singleton live-birth, the highest success rates for this group were with one embryo transferred. This also was true for women aged 35--37 years with elective single embryo transfers on day 5 (Table 8)., Among patients who used freshly fertilized embryos from their own eggs, the live-birth rates and multiple-birth risks typically were higher for embryo transfers on day 5 than on day 3 (Table 7). Overall, across all age groups, fewer embryos were transferred on day 5 than on day 3. For example, among women aged <35 years, two or fewer embryos were transferred in 86% of day 5 transfers and in 57% of day 3 transfers. Similarly, in women aged <35 years, 92% of day 5 elective transfers and 67% of day 3 elective transfers involved the transfer of two or fewer embryos. As noted previously, both live-birth rates and multiple-birth risks were higher for patients who had elective embryo transfers. For women with elective embryo transfer on day 5 who were aged <35 years, the percentage of transfers resulting in live births was 48% when one embryo was transferred and 58% when two embryos were transferred. By contrast, the multiple-birth risks in these two groups were 3% and 44%, respectively. Thus, the 10% increase in the live-birth rate was accompanied by a 41% increase in the risk for a multiple delivery. If success is measured in terms of singleton live-birth, the highest success rates for this group were with one embryo transferred. This also was true for women aged 35--37 years with elective single embryo transfers on day 5 (Table 7)., Among patients who used freshly fertilized embryos from their own eggs, the live-birth rates and multiple-birth risks typically were higher for embryo transfers on day 5 than on day 3 (Table 7).

For example, among day 3 embryo transfers in women aged <35 years, 52% involved the transfer of two or fewer embryos whereas 82% of day 5 embryo transfers in women aged <35 years involved the transfer of two or fewer embryos. Similarly, in women aged <35 years, 62% of day 3 elective embryo transfers and 90% of day 5 elective embryos transfers involved the transfer of two or more embryos. As noted previously for all day of embryo transfers (Table 6), live-birth rates and multiple-birth risks were even higher for patients who had elective embryo transfers. For women with elective embryo transfer on day 5 who were aged <35 years, live birth rates were 52% when one embryo was transferred and 57% when two embryos were transferred. By contrast, the multiple-birth risks in these two groups were 4% and 45%, respectively.

Semen is the thick, white fluid released from the penis during sexual climax (orgasm). This release is called ejaculation. Semen contains sperm, the cells made in the male reproductive system that include the genetic material needed to make a baby., How does a semen analysis work: A man masturbates to produce a semen sample. This is the preferred method because it provides a clean sample. Since sperm counts vary from day to day, you may need to provide more than one sample spaced out a few weeks apart.]   \n",

       "6   Q: I heard that the vitamin K shot might cause cancer. Is this true: A: No. In the early 1990s, a small study in England found an “association” between the vitamin K shot and childhood cancer. An association means that two things are happening at the same time in the same person, but doesn’t tell us whether one causes the other. Figuring out whether vitamin K might cause childhood cancer was very important because every newborn is expected to get a vitamin K shot. If vitamin K was causing cancer, we would expect to see the same association in other groups of children. Scientists looked to see if they could find the same association in other children, but this association between vitamin K and childhood cancer was never found again in any other study.  \n",

An association means that two things are happening at the same time in the same person, but doesn’t tell us whether one causes the other. Figuring out whether vitamin K might cause childhood cancer was very important because every newborn is expected to get a vitamin K shot. If vitamin K was causing cancer, we would expect to see the same association in other groups of children. Scientists looked to see if they could find the same association in other children, but this association between vitamin K and childhood cancer was never found again in any other study.  \n",
