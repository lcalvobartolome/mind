Your input fields are:

PASSAGE (str)
FULL_DOCUMENT (str)

Your output fields are:

reasoning (str): Reasoning about whether the passage contains objective information
SUMMARY (str): A concise summary of the FULL_DOCUMENT that contextualizes the PASSAGE if it contains objective information; leave empty if it does not contain objective information

All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## PASSAGE ## ]]
{{PASSAGE}}

[[ ## FULL_DOCUMENT ## ]]
{{FULL_DOCUMENT}}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
{{reasoning}}

[[ ## SUMMARY ## ]]
{{SUMMARY}}

[[ ## completed ## ]]

In adhering to this structure, your objective is:
    1. Determine whether the PASSAGE contains objective information:
        - Objective information includes verifiable content such as procedures, factual data, or universally applicable details.
        - Not objective: Personal experiences (e.g., the history of a certain patient), opinions, anecdotes, individual stories, directories, lists of information, or author affiliations.
    2. If the PASSAGE contains objective information, provide a summary of the FULL_DOCUMENT as described. Otherwise, leave this field empty.
