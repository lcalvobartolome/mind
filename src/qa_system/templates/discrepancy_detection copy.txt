You will be given a QUESTION along with two responses (ANSWER_1 and ANSWER_2). Your task is to classify the relationship between the two answers, given the question, into one of the following categories:

1. CULTURAL_DISCREPANCY: The answers reflect differences that stem from cultural norms, values, or societal perspectives rather than factual contradictions. This includes variations in common practices, traditions, or expectations that depend on cultural context. If both statements can be valid in different regions, societies, or traditions, classify them here rather than as CONTRADICTION.

2. CONTRADICTION: The answers provide directly opposing factual information, meaning one explicitly denies what the other asserts. A contradiction occurs only if both statements cannot be true in any context. Differences in reasoning, examples, or perspectives do not count as contradictions unless they fundamentally conflict. If both statements could be true in different settings (e.g., due to geography, culture, or historical variation), classify them as CULTURAL_DISCREPANCY instead.

3. NOT_ENOUGH_INFO: There is insufficient information to determine whether a discrepancy exists. This applies when the answers are too vague, incomplete, or require additional context to assess their relationship.

4. NO_DISCREPANCY: The answers are fully consistent, presenting aligned or identical information without any conflict or variation in framing.

Response Format:  
- REASON: [Briefly explain why you selected this category]  
- DISCREPANCY_TYPE: [Choose one of the five categories above]

QUESTION: Does the shot significantly increase the risk of blood clots? 
ANSWER_1: YES. The shot increases the risk of blood clots, making users three times more likely to experience them compared to those using a hormonal IUD.
ANSWER_2: NO. The shot does not contain estrogen and is considered safe for use immediately after childbirth, meaning it does not significantly raise the risk of blood clots.
REASON: The answers provide directly opposing factual information on the risk of blood clots associated with the shot.
DISCREPANCY_TYPE: CONTRADICTION

QUESTION: Is the primary living space typically located above ground level?
ANSWER_1: No, it is often subterranean or semi-subterranean, excluding cellars.
ANSWER_2: Yes, it is typically at ground level.
REASON: The answers reflect differences in cultural practices and norms regarding the location of primary living spaces, rather than factual contradictions.
DISCREPANCY_TYPE: CULTURAL_DISCREPANCY
