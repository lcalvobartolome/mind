"Testosterone is a hormone that your gonads (sex organs) mainly produce. More specifically, the testicles in people assigned male at birth (AMAB) and the ovaries in people assigned female at birth (AFAB) produce testosterone.","In the brain, the hypothalamus releases chemicals (hormones) that cause the pituitary gland to release hormones called gonadotropins. Gonadotropins stimulate the growth of the sex glands (also called gonads), which in boys are the testicles, and in girls are the ovaries. In boys, the testicles release testosterone; in girls, the ovaries release estrogen. Puberty usually starts between the ages of 8 and 13 in girls and 9 and 14 in boys.","Passage 1 claims that ovaries produce testosterone, while Passage 2 implies that ovaries primarily release estrogen and does not mention the production of testosterone.",Direct Contradiction
"With one important exception. The exception was the shot. Compared to women using a hormonal IUD, women using the shot were three times more likely to have a blood clot.","Careful, not all methods are safe for new moms to use: As if they didn’t have their hands full already, women who have just given birth have to be especially careful when choosing a contraceptive. The CDC has just updated its guidelines on which methods are safe for new moms to use, and when. While hormonal methods that don’t contain estrogen—the shot, the Mirena IUD, the implant and the mini-pill—are safe for women to use immediately after giving birth, combination pills, which contain estrogen, shouldn’t be used until three weeks after giving birth, since estrogen can increase a woman’s risk of blood clots.","Passage 1 states that women using the shot are three times more likely to have a blood clot compared to those using a hormonal IUD, whereas Passage 2 claims that the shot is safe for immediate use postpartum because it doesn't contain estrogen, which is the component associated with an increased risk of blood clots.",Direct Contradiction
"Cal’s skin was described to be jaundiced again through visual assessment when he was 23 hours old, but a bilirubin test was not done. Neither was his blood typed or a Coombes test performed.","Diagnosis: At a minimum, babies should be checked for jaundice every 8 to 12 hours in the first 48 hours of life. It is important for your baby to be seen by a nurse or doctor when the baby is between 3 and 5 days old, because this is usually when a baby’s bilirubin level is highest. This is why, if your baby is discharged before age 72 hours, your baby should be seen within 2 days of discharge. The timing of this visit may vary depending on your baby’s age when released from the hospital and other factors.","Passage 1 describes a case where a baby showing signs of jaundice was not given a bilirubin test or other relevant tests before being discharged at 36 hours old, which contradicts the guidelines in Passage 2 that recommend checking for jaundice every 8 to 12 hours in the first 48 hours and ensuring follow-up visits if discharged before 72 hours.",Major Discrepancy
The word prenatal means before birth. Trimester means 3 months. A normal pregnancy is around 10 months and has 3 trimesters.,"The average length of pregnancy is 280 days, or 40 weeks. But there is no way to know exactly when you will go into labor. Most women give birth between 38 and 41 weeks of pregnancy. The more you know about what to expect during labor, the better prepared you will be once it begins.","Passage 1 states that a normal pregnancy is around 10 months (which would imply 43-44 weeks), while Passage 2 states that the average length of pregnancy is 40 weeks, with most women giving birth between 38 and 41 weeks.",Direct Contradiction
Key points about pregnancy loss: Pregnancy loss is the death of an unborn baby (fetus) at any time during pregnancy. Pregnancy loss occurs in up to 1 in every 4 pregnancies. Most happen during the first trimester. About half of early pregnancy losses are from defects in genes or chromosomes. Vaginal bleeding is the most common symptom of pregnancy loss.,"What is my risk of miscarriage by week: Your risk of pregnancy loss declines each week you’re pregnant. Around 15% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Miscarriage risk in the second trimester (13 to 19 weeks) is between 1% and 5%. Many factors affect your risk of miscarriage such as your age and health. However, everyone’s risk of miscarriage declines each week of pregnancy if the pregnant person has no other health conditions.","Passage 1 states that pregnancy loss occurs in up to 25% of pregnancies, whereas Passage 2 states that around 15% of pregnancies end in miscarriage.",Major Discrepancy
"IBS can be painful, but it doesn’t lead to other health problems or damage the digestive tract.","Luckily, diarrhea is usually short-lived, lasting no more than a few days. But when diarrhea lasts beyond a few days into weeks, it usually indicates that there's another problem — such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a more serious disorder, including persistent infection, celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).","Passage 1 states that IBS doesn't lead to other health problems or damage the digestive tract, while Passage 2 suggests that prolonged diarrhea can indicate IBS or more serious conditions, which may imply IBS is a serious issue.",Major Discrepancy
