1,1,"Q: I heard that the vitamin K shot might cause cancer. Is this true: A: No. In the early 1990s, a small study in England found an “association” between the vitamin K shot and childhood cancer. An association means that two things are happening at the same time in the same person, but doesn’t tell us whether one causes the other. Figuring out whether vitamin K might cause childhood cancer was very important because every newborn is expected to get a vitamin K shot. If vitamin K was causing cancer, we would expect to see the same association in other groups of children. Scientists looked to see if they could find the same association in other children, but this association between vitamin K and childhood cancer was never found again in any other study.","['In the early 1990s, a small study in England found an association between the vitamin K shot and childhood cancer.', 'An association means that two things are happening at the same time in the same person but does not tell us whether one causes the other.', 'Figuring out whether vitamin K might cause childhood cancer was very important because every newborn is expected to get a vitamin K shot.', 'If vitamin K was causing cancer, scientists would expect to see the same association in other groups of children.', 'Scientists looked to see if they could find the same association between vitamin K and childhood cancer in other children.', 'The association between vitamin K and childhood cancer was never found again in any other study.']","['In the early 1990s, a small study in England found an association between the vitamin K shot and childhood cancer.', 'An association means that two things are happening at the same time in the same person but does not tell us whether one causes the other.', 'Figuring out whether vitamin K might cause childhood cancer was very important because every newborn is expected to get a vitamin K shot.', 'If vitamin K was causing cancer, scientists would expect to see the same association in other groups of children.', 'Scientists looked to see if they could find the same association between vitamin K and childhood cancer in other children.', 'The association between vitamin K and childhood cancer was never found again in any other study.']","['Did a small study in England in the early 1990s find an association between the vitamin K shot and childhood cancer?', 'Does an association mean that two things are happening at the same time in the same person but does not tell us whether one causes the other?', 'Was it important to figure out whether vitamin K might cause childhood cancer because every newborn is expected to get a vitamin K shot?', 'Do scientists expect to see the same association between vitamin K and cancer in other groups of children?\n\n---', 'Did scientists investigate the association between vitamin K and childhood cancer in other children?', 'Was the association between vitamin K and childhood cancer ever found again in any other study?']"
