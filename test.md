These questions are based on content that does not reflect generalizable knowledge and is unlikely to have a corresponding passage in the comparison corpus. Since applying additional filtering to remove these cases would make the pipeline overly tailored to this specific corpus, we are instead aiming to fine-tune the question generation model to avoid producing such questions altogether.
